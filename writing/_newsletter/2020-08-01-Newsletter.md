This newsletter is a collection of things I have found in the last month that I enjoyed, found interesting, or simply wanted to share.

You can follow me more closely at [my personal website](http://claycarson.net "Personal Website") or if you or someone you know is looking to buy or sell a home, you can point them to [my real estate website](http://claycarson.com "Business Website ").

## How Low Can You Go

[What would Tiger Woods shoot on your home course?](https://mygolfspy.com/tour-stats-what-would-tiger-shoot-on-your-home-course/ "What would Tiger Woods shoot on your home course?")

> For the past 25 years, we’ve watched Tiger dominate on some of the toughest courses in the world. If you’re anything like me, you’ve asked yourself, “How good would Tiger be at my course from my tees?”.
> 
> Recently, a good friend asked me an interesting question: “If tour players entered their scores just like we do, what would their USGA handicap index be?”  I ran the numbers and it was eye-popping.

##  And I quote, “A fucking bitch”

> And so what I believe is that having a daughter does not make a man decent. Having a wife does not make a decent man. Treating people with dignity and respect makes a decent man, and when a decent man messes up as we all are bound to do, he tries his best and does apologize. Not to save face, not to win a vote, he apologizes genuinely to repair and acknowledge the harm done so that we can all move on.
> 
> Lastly, what I want to express to Mr. Yoho is gratitude. **I want to thank him for showing the world that you can be a powerful man and accost women. You can have daughters and accost women without remorse. You can be married and accost women. You can take photos and project an image to the world of being a family man and accost women without remorse and with a sense of impunity.** It happens every day in this country. It happened here on the steps of our nation’s Capitol. It happens when individuals who hold the highest office in this land admit, admit to hurting women and using this language against all of us.
