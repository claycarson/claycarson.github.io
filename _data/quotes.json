No one had ever heard of it, but that didn’t stop Adidas from kicking up a fuss.\n\nAggravated, I drove up the mountain to Bowerman’s house to talk it all over. We sat on the wide porch, looking down at the river. It sparkled that day like a silver shoelace. He took off his ball cap, put it on again, rubbed his face. “Who was that guy who kicked the shit out of the Aztecs?” he asked. “Cortez,” I said. He grunted. “Okay. Let’s call it the Cortez.”\n","id":"recHstEnD7Co23qH8"},{"date":"2017-11-20","type":"Quote","creator":"Arnold H.
