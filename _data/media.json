Maximus\n\n\\\u003e The sense he gave of \\*staying\\* on the path rather than being \\*kept\\* on it.\n\n\\### 16. My Adopted Father\n\n\\\u003e Compassion. Unwavering adherence to decisions, once he'd reached them. Indifference to superficial honors. Hard work. Persistence.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e Listening to anyone who could contribute to the public good.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e His dogged determination to treat people as they deserved.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e A sense of when to push and when to back off.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e Putting a stop to the pursuit of boys.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e His altruism. Not expecting his friends to keep him entertained at dinner or to travel with him (unless they wanted to). And anyone who had to stay behind to take care of something always found him the same when he returned.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e His searching questions at meetings. A kind of single-mindedness, almost, never content with first impressions, or breaking off the discussion prematurely.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e His constancy to friends-never getting fed up with them, or playing favorites.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e Self-reliance, always. And cheerfulness.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e And his advance planning (well in advance) and his discreet attention to even minor things.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e His restrictions on acclamations-and all attempts to flatter him.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e His constant devotion to the empire's needs. His stewardship the treasury. His willingness to take responsibility-and blame-for both.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e His attitude to the gods: no superstitiousness. And his attitude to men: no demagoguery, no currying favor, no pandering. Alway gained from doing it. Always sober, always steady, and never vulgar or prey to fads.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e The way he handled the material comforts that fortune had supplied him in such abundance-without arrogance and without apology. If there were there, he took advantage of them. If not, he didn't miss them. \n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e No one ever called him glib, or shameless, or pedantic. They saw him for what he was: a man tested by life, accomplished, unswayed by flattery, qualified to govern both himself and them.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e His respect for people who practiced philosophy-at least, those who were sincere about it. But without denigrating the others-or listening to them.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e His ability to feel at ease with people-and put them at \\*there\\* ease, without being pushy.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e His willingness to take adequate care of himself. Not a hypochondriac or obsessed with his appearance, but not ignoring things either. With the result that he hardly ever needed medical attention, or drugs or any sort of salve or ointment.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e This, in particular: his willingness to yield the floor to experts--in oratory, law, psychology, whatever--and to support them energetically, so that each of them could fulfill his potential.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e That he respected tradition without needing to constantly congratulate himself for Safeguarding Our Traditional Values.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e Not prone to go off on tangents, or pulled in all directions, but sticking with the same old places and the same old things.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e The way he could have one of his migraines and then go right back to what he was doing-fresh and at the top of his game.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e That he had so few secrets-only state secrets, in fact, and not all that many of those.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e The way he kept public actions within reasonable bounds-games, building projects, distributions of money and so on--because he looked to what needed doing and not the credit to be gained from doing both.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e No bathing at strange hours, no self-indulgent building projects no concern for food, or the cut and color of his clothes, or haying attractive slaves. (The robe from his farm at Lorium, most of the things at Lanuvium, the way he accepted the customs agent's way apology at Tusculum, etc.)\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e He never exhibited rudeness, lost control of himself, or turned violent. No one ever saw him sweat. Everything was to be approached logically and with due consideration, in a calm and orderly fashion but decisively, and with no loose ends.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e You could have said of him (as they say of Socrates) that he knew how to enjoy and abstain from things that most people find it hard to abstain from and all too easy to enjoy. Strength, perseverance, self-control in both areas: the mark of a soul in readiness--indomitable.\n\n\u003c!-- Page 12 --\u003e\n\\### 17. The Gods\n\n\\\u003e That I wasn't more talented in rhetoric or poetry, or other areas. If I'd felt that I was making better progress I might never have given them up.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e [...]\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e That when I became interested in philosophy I didn't fall into the hands of charlatans, and didn't get bogged down in writing treatises, or become absorbed by logic-chopping, or preoccupied with physics.\n\n\\## Book 2\n\n\u003c!-- Page 18 --\u003e \n3\\\\. \n\n\\\u003eThe world is maintained by change--in the elements and in the things they compose. That should be enough for you; treat it as an axiom.\n\n\n4\\\\.\n\n\\\u003eThere is a limit to the time assigned you, and if you don't use it to free yourself it will be gone and will never return.\n\n5\\\\. \n\n\\\u003eConcentrate every minute like a Roman-like a man--on doing what's in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing yourself from all other distractions. Yes, you can-if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable. You see how few things you have to do to live a satisfying and reverent life? If you can manage this, that's all even the gods can ask of you.\n\n\n6\\\\. \n\n\\\u003eEveryone gets one life. Yours is almost used up, and instead of treating yourself with respect, you have entrusted your own happiness to the souls of others.\n\n\u003c!-- Page 20 --\u003e\n11\\\\.\n\n\\\u003e You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think. If the gods exist, then to abandon human beings is not frightening; the gods would never subject you to harm. And they don't exist, or don't care what happens to us, what would he the point of living in a world without gods or Providence? But they do exist, they do care what happens to us, and everything a person needs to avoid real harm they have placed within him. If there were anything harmful on the other side of death, they would have made sure that the ability to avoid it was within you. If it doesn't harm your character, how can it harm your life? Nature would not have overlooked such dangers through failing to recognize them, or because it saw them but was powerless to prevent or correct them. Nor would it ever, through inability or incompetence, make such a mistake as to let good and bad things happen indiscriminately to good and bad alike. \\*\\*But death and life, success and failure, pain and pleasure, wealth and poverty, all these happen to good and bad alike, and they are neither noble nor shameful-and hence neither good nor bad.\\*\\*\n\n\\## Book 3\n\n\u003c!-- Page 31 --\u003e\n6\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e It would be wrong for anything to stand between you and attaining goodness-- as a rational being and a citizen. Anything at all: the applause of the crowd, high office, wealth, or self-indulgence. All of them might seem to be compatible with it-- for a while. But suddenly they control us and sweep us away.\n\n7\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e Never regard something as doing you good if it makes you betray a trust, or lose your sense of shame, or makes you show hatred, suspicion, ill will, or hypocrisy, or a desire for things best done behind closed doors. If you can privilege your own mind, guiding spirit and your reverence for its powers, that should clear of dramatics, of wailing and gnashing of teeth. You won't need solitude-or a cast of thousands, either. Above all, you'll be free of fear and desire. And how long your body will contain the soul that inhabits it will cause you not a moment's worry. If it's time for you to go, leave willingly-as you would to accomplish anything that can be done with grace and honor. And concentrate on this, your whole life long: for your mind to be in the right state-the state a rational, civic mind should be in.\n\n\u003c!-- Page 32 --\u003e\n10\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e Forget everything else. Keep hold of this alone and remember it: Each of us lives only now, this brief instant. The rest has bee lived already; or is impossible to see. Thes pan we live is small--small as the corner of the earch in which we live it. Small as even the greatest renown, passed from outh to mouth by short-lived stick figures, ignorant alike of themselves and those long dead.\n\n\u003c!-- Page 33 --\u003e\n12\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e If you do the job in a principled way, with diligence, energy and pations, if you keep yourself free of distractions, and keep the spirit inside you undamaged, as if you might have to give it back at any moment--\n\\\u003e \t\n\\\u003e If you can embrace this without fear or expectation--can find fulfillment in what you're doing now, as Nature intended, and in superhuman truthfulness (every wod, every utterance)-- then your life with be happy.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e No one can prevent that.\n\n\\## Book 4\n\n\u003c!-- Page 37 --\u003e\n3\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e People try to get away from it all-to the country, to the beach, to the mountains. You always wish that you could too. Which is idiotic: you can get away from it anytime you like. \n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e By going within.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e Nowhere you can go is more peaceful-more free of interruptions-than your own soul. Especially if you have other things to rely on. An instant's recollection and there it is: complete tranquillity. And by tranquillity I mean a kind of harmony.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e So keep getting away from it all-like that. Renew yourself. But keep it brief and basic. A quick visit should be enough to ward off all\u003c...\u003e and send you back ready to face what awaits you.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e What's there to complain about? People's misbehavior? But take into consideration:\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e - that rational beings exist for one another;\n\\\u003e - that doing what's right sometimes requires patience;\n\\\u003e - that no one does the wrong thing deliberately; \n\\\u003e - and the number of people who have feuded and envied and hated and fought and died and been buried.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e ... and keep your mouth shut.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e Or are you complaining about the things the world assigns you? But consider the two options: Providence or atoms. And all the arguments for seeing the world as a city.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e Or is it your body? Keep in mind that when the mind detaches itself and realizes its own nature, it no longer has anything to do with ordinary life-the rough and the smooth, either one. And remember all you've been taught-and accepted-about pain and pleasure.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e Or is it your reputation that's bothering you? But look at how soon we're all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. The emptiness of all those applauding hands. The people who praise us-how capricious they are, how arbitrary. And the tiny region in which it all takes place. The whole earth a point in space and most of it uninhabited. How many people there will be to admire you, and who they are.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e So keep this refuge in mind: the back roads of your self. Above all, no strain and no stress. Be straightforward. Look at things like a man, like a human being, like a citizen, like a mortal. And among the things you turn to, these two:\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e 1. That things have no hold on the soul. They stand there unmoving, outside it. Disturbance comes only from within--from our own perceptions.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e 2. That everything you see will soon alter and cease to exist. Think of how many changes you've already seen.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e \"The world is nothing but change. Our life is only perception.\n\n\u003c!-- Page 39 --\u003e\n7\\\\. \n\n\\\u003eChoose not to be harmed--and you won't feel harmed. Don't feel harmed--and you haven't been\n\n8\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e It can ruin your life only if it ruins your character. Otherwise it cannot harm you--inside or out.\n\n\u003c!-- Page 41 --\u003e\n19\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e People who are excited by posthumous fame forget that the people who remember them will soon die too. And those after them in turn. Until their memory, passed from one to another like a candle flame, gutters and goes out\n\n\u003c!-- Page 42 --\u003e\n24\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e \"If you seek tranquillity, do less.\" Or (more accurately) do what's essential--what the logos of a social being requires, and in the requisite way. Which brings a double satisfaction: to do less, better.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you'll have more time, and more tranquillity. As yourself at every moment, \"Is this necessary?\"\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e But we need to eliminate unnecessary assumptions as well. To eliminate the unnecessary actions that follow.\n\n\u003c!-- Page 43 --\u003e \n26\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e Don't be disturbed. Uncomplicate yourself.\n\n\u003c!-- Page 44 --\u003e\n31\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e Love the discipline you know, and let it support you. Entrust everything willingly to the gods, and then make your way through life--\\*\\*No one's master and no one's slave.\\*\\*\n\n\u003c!-- Page 45 --\u003e\n32\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e You're better off not giving small things more time than they deserve.\n\n33\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e Then what should we work for?\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e Only this: proper understanding; unselfish action; truthful speech. A resolve to accept whatever happens as necessary and familiar, flowing like water from the same source and spring.\n\n36\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e Constant awareness that everything is born from change. The knowledge that there is nothing nature loves more than to alter what exists and make new things like it. All that exists is the seed of what will emerge from it.\n\n\u003c!-- Page 46 --\u003e\n39\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e Nothing that goes on in anyone else's mind can harm you. Nor can the shifts and changes in the world around you.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e -Then where is harm to be found?\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e In your capacity to see it. Stop doing that and everything will be fine. Let the part of you that makes that judgment keep quiet even if the body it's attached to is stabbed or burnt, or stinking with pus, or consumed by cancer. Or to put it another way: It needs to realize that what happens to everyone-bad and good alike-is neither good nor bad. That what happens in every life-lived naturally or not-is neither natural nor unnatural.\n\n41\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e\"A little wisp of soul carrying a corpse. -- Epictetus\"\n\n43\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e Time is a river, a violent current of events, glimpsed once and already carried past us, and another follows and is gone.\n\n\u003c!-- Page 47 --\u003e\n47\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e Suppose that a god announced that you were going to die tomorrow \"or the day after\". Unless you were a complete coward you wouldn't kick up a fuss about which day it was--what difference could it make? \\*\\*Now recognize that the difference between years from now and tomorrow is just as small.\\*\\*\n\n\u003c!-- Page 48 --\u003e\n48\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e In short, know this: Human lives are brief and trivial. Yesterday a blob of semen; tomorrow embalming fluid, ash.\n\n49a. \n\n\\\u003e It's unfortunate that this has happened.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e No. It's fortunate that this has happened and I've remained unharmed by it-not shattered by the present or frightened of the future. It could have happened to anyone. But not everyone could have remained unharmed by it. Why treat the one as a misfortune rather than the other as fortunate? Can you really call something a misfortune that doesn't violate human nature? Or do you think something that's not against nature's will can violate it? But you know what its will is. Does what's happened keep you from acting with justice, generosity, self-control, sanity, prudence, honesty, humility, straightforwardness, and all the other qualities that allow a person's nature to fulfill itself?\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e So remember this principle when something threatens to cause you pain: the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is great good fortune.\n\n\\## Book 5\n\n\u003c!-- Page 53 --\u003e\n1\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself \"I have to go to work-as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I'm going to do what I was born for-the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?\"\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e -But it's nicer here....\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e So you were born to feel \"nice\"? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don't you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you're not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren't you running to do what your nature demands?\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e -But we have to sleep sometime....\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e Agreed. But nature set a limit on that-as it did on eating and drinking. And you're over the limit. You've had more than enough of that. But not of working. There you're still below your quota.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e You don't love yourself enough. Or you'd love your nature too, and what it demands of you. People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to wash or eat. Do you have less respect for your own nature than the engraver does for engraving, the dancer for the dance, the miser for money or the social climber for status? When they're really possessed by what they do, they'd rather stop eating and sleeping than give up practicing their arts.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e Is helping others less valuable to you? Not worth your effort?\n\n\u003c!-- Page 56 --\u003e\n3\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e If action or utterance is appropriate, then it's appropriate for you. Don't be put off by other people's comments and criticism. If it's right to say or do, then it's the right thing for you to do or say.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e The others obey their own lead, follow their own impulses. Don't be distracted. Keep walking. Follow your own nature, and follow Nature--along the road they share.\n\n8\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e So there are two reasons to embrace what happens. One is that it's happening to \\*you\\*. It was prescribed for you, and it pertains to you. The thread was spun long ago, by the oldest cause of all.\n\n\u003c!-- Page 57 --\u003e\n9\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e Not to feel exasperated, or defeated, or despondent because your days aren't packed with wise and moral actions. But to get back up when you fail, to celebrate behaving like a human--however imperfectly--and fully embrace the pursuit that you've embarked on.\n\n\u003c!-- Page 58 --\u003e\n13\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e I am made up of substance and what animates it, and neither one can ever stop existing, any more than it began to. Every portion of me will be reassigned as another portion of the world, and that in turn transformed into another. Ad infinitum.\n\n\u003c!-- Page 60 --\u003e\n18\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e Nothing happens to anyone that he can't endure. The same thing happens to other people, and they weather it unharmed--out of sheer obliviousness or because they want to display \"character.\" Is wisdom really so much weaker than ignorance and vanity?\n\n\u003c!-- Page 61 --\u003e\n22\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e When you think you've been injured, apply this rule: If the community isn't injured by it, neither am I. And if it is, anger is not the answer. Show the offender where he went wrong.\n\n23\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e So it would take an idiot to feel self-importance or distress. Or an indignation either. As if the things that irritate us lasted.\n\n25\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e So other people hurt me? That's their problem. Their character and actions are not mine.\n\n29\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e And I want what is proper to rational beings, living together.\n\n\u003c!-- Page 63 --\u003e\n31\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e Consider all that you've gone through, all that you've survived. And that the story of your life is done, your assignment complete. How many good things have you seen? How much pain and pleasure have you resisted? How many honors have you declined?

Your destruction will mean its end as well.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e Just remember: you can endure anything y our mind can make endurable, by treating it as in your interest to do so.\n\n4\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e If they've made a mistake, correct them gently and show them where they went wrong. If you can't do that, then the blame lies with you. Or no one.\n\n5\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e Whatever happens to you has been waiting to happen since the beginning of time.\n\n6\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e Whether it's atoms or nature, the first thing to be said is this: I am a part of a world controlled by nature. Secondly: that I have relationship with other, similar parts. And with that in mind I have no right, as a part, to complain about what is assigned me by the whole. Because what benefits the whole can't harm the parts, and the whole does nothing that doesn't benefit it. That's a trait shared by all natures, but the nature of the world is defined by a second characteristic as well: no outside force can compel it to cause itself harm.\n\\\u003e\n\\\u003e So by keeping in mind the whole I form a part of, I'll accept whatever happens. And because of my relationship to other parts, I will do nothing selfish, but aim instead to join them, to direct my every action toward what benefits us all and to avoid what doesn't.\n\\\u003e\n\\\u003e If I do all that, then my life should go smoothly. As you might expect a citizen's life to go--one whose actions serve his fellow citizens, and who embraces the community's decree.\n\n\u003c!-- Page 136 --\u003e\n12\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e Why all this guesswork? You can see what needs to be done. If you can see the road, follow it. Cheerfully, without turning back. If not, hold up and get the best advice you can. If anything gets in the way, forge on ahead, making good use of what you have on hand, sticking to what seems right.\n\n\u003c!-- Page 137 --\u003e\n16\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e To stop talking about what the good man is like, and just be one.\n\n18\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e Bear in mind that everything that exists is already fraying at the edges, and in transition, subject to fragmentation and to rot.\n\n\u003c!-- Page 139 --\u003e\n27\\\\. \n\n\\\u003e To bear in mind constantly that all of this has happened before.

When you’re born, you’re given a randomly generated character, with a randomly determined name, race, face, and social class. Your body is your avatar, and you spawn in a random geographic location, at a random moment in human history, surrounded by a random group of people, and then you have to try to survive for as long as you can. Sometimes the game might seem easy. Even fun. Other times it might be so difficult you want to give up and quit. But unfortunately, in this game you only get one life. When your body grows too hungry or thirsty or ill or injured or old, your health meter runs out and then it’s Game Over. Some people play the game for a hundred years without ever figuring out that it’s a game, or that there is a way to win it. To win the videogame of life you just have to try to make the experience of being forced to play it as pleasant as possible, for yourself, and for all of the other players you encounter in your travels. Kira says that if everyone played the game to win, it’d be a lot more fun for everyone. \n\n\\## Vocabulary\n\n\\- Fusillade - a number of shots fired simultaneously or in rapid

Processes are about what you do. \n\n\\\u003e The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. \n\n\\\u003e On any given day, you may struggle with your habits because you’re too busy or too tired or too overwhelmed or hundreds of other reasons. Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way. This is why you can’t get too attached to one version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. \n\n\\\u003e First, decide who you want to be. This holds at any level—as an individual, as a team, as a community, as a nation. What do you want to stand for? What are your principles and values? Who do you wish to become? \n\n\\\u003e You have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your identity is not set in stone. You have a choice in every moment. You can choose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today. And this brings us to the deeper purpose of this book and the real reason habits matter. \n\n\\### 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps\n\n\\\u003e How can I make it obvious? How can I make it attractive? How can I make it easy? How can I make it satisfying? \n\n\\## THE 1ST LAW: Make It Obvious \n\\### 7: The Secret to Self-Control\n\n\\\u003e When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals aren’t all that different from those who are struggling. Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations. \n\n\\\u003e So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment. \n\n\\## THE 2ND LAW: Make It Attractive \n\\### 8: How to Make a Habit Irresistible\n\\\u003e Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them. The wanting centers in the brain are large: the brain stem, the nucleus accumbens, the ventral tegmental area, the dorsal striatum, the amygdala, and portions of the prefrontal cortex. By comparison, the liking centers of the brain are much smaller. They are often referred to as “hedonic hot spots” and are distributed like tiny islands throughout the brain. For instance, researchers have found that 100 percent of the nucleus accumbens is activated during wanting. Meanwhile, only 10 percent of the structure is activated during liking. The fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to the regions responsible for craving and desire provides further evidence of the crucial role these processes play. Desire is the engine that drives behavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response.\n\n\\### 9: The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits \n\\\u003e One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. \n\n\\\u003e Your culture sets your expectation for what is “normal.” Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself. You’ll rise together. \n\n\\## THE 3RD LAW: Make It Easy \n\\### 12: The Law of Least Effort\n\\\u003e Trying to pump up your motivation to stick with a hard habit is like trying to force water through a bent hose. You can do it, but it requires a lot of effort and increases the tension in your life. Meanwhile, making your habits simple and easy is like removing the bend in the hose. Rather than trying to overcome the friction in your life, you reduce it.\n\n\\### 13: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule\n\\\u003e Researchers estimate that 40 to 50 percent of our actions on any given day are done out of habit. This is already a substantial percentage, but the true influence of your habits is even greater than these numbers suggest. Habits are automatic choices that influence the conscious decisions that follow. Yes, a habit can be completed in just a few seconds, but it can also shape the actions that you take for minutes or hours afterward. \n\n\n\\### 14: How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible\n\\\u003e Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard. \n\n\n\\## THE 4TH LAW: Make It Satisfying \n\\### 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change\n\\\u003e The consequences of bad habits are delayed while the rewards are immediate. \n\n\\### 16: How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day\n\\\u003e Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly. The breaking of a habit doesn’t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast. \n\n\\\u003e This is sometimes referred to as Goodhart’s Law. Named after the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in the overall system. \n\n\\## ADVANCED TACTICS: How to Go from Being Merely Good to Being Truly Great \n\\\u003e 18: The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don’t)\n\n\\\u003e Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. \n\\\u003e \n\\### 19: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work\n\\\u003e While there is still much to learn, one of the most consistent findings is that the way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks of “just manageable difficulty.” \n\n\\\u003e The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right. \n\n\\\u003e “What’s the difference between the best athletes and everyone else?” I asked. “What do the really successful people do that most don’t?” He mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent. But then he said something I wasn’t expecting: “At some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over.” \n\n\\\u003e As Machiavelli noted, “Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.” \n\n\\\u003e At some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self-improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom. \n\n\\### 20: The Downside of Creating Good Habits\n\\\u003e In the words of investor Paul Graham, “keep your identity small.” The more you let a single belief define you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you. \n\n\\\u003e Habits deliver numerous benefits, but the downside is that they can lock us into our previous patterns of thinking and acting—even when the world is shifting around us. Everything is impermanent. Life is constantly changing, so you need to periodically check in to see if your old habits and beliefs are still serving you.\n \n\\## Conclusion: The Secret to Results That Last\n\\\u003e In the beginning, small improvements can often seem meaningless because they get washed away by the weight of the system. Just as one coin won’t make you rich, one positive change like meditating for one minute or reading one page each day is unlikely to deliver a noticeable difference. Gradually, though, as you continue to layer small changes on top of one another, the scales of life start to move. Each improvement is like adding a grain of sand to the positive side of the scale, slowly tilting things in your favor. Eventually, if you stick with it, you hit a tipping point. Suddenly, it feels easier to stick with good habits. The weight of the system is working for you rather than against you. \n \n\\## Appendix \n\\## Little Lessons from the Four Laws\n\\\u003e This is the wisdom behind Seneca’s famous quote, “Being poor is not having too little, it is wanting more.” If your wants outpace your likes, you’ll always be unsatisfied. You’re perpetually putting more weight on the problem than the solution. \n","method":["Digital"],"rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recJHfi9zleqjxbFV"},{"title":"Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions","media":"Movie","date":"2020-12-17","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/taylor-swift-folklore-the-long-pond-studio-sessions/","rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-17T15:49:19.000Z","id":"recZuyQ0R7j9TzxSN"},{"title":"The Shotgun Start","media":"Podcast","date":"2020-12-16","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-shotgun-start/id1435273901","episode":"Bank Teller Family Championship and the Gulbis Exemption","duration":2520,"created_time":"2020-12-16T16:03:41.000Z","id":"recE6kpsI7x0Lv38Y"},{"title":"The West Wing","media":"TV","date":"2020-12-16","status":"Complete","season":"Season 4","rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-17T14:50:16.000Z","id":"recNyYV0TKZiKyOJb"},{"title":"The West Wing","media":"TV","date":"2020-12-15","date_updated":"2021-02-10","status":"Current","summary":"\n","episode":"S06E04","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:33:35.000Z","id":"recGrNkYiQNVps6Oz"},{"title":"No Laying Up","media":"Podcast","date":"2020-12-15","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://nolayingup.com/podcasts/no-laying-up-podcast?page=1","episode":"385: U.S. Women’s Open Recap","duration":1560,"created_time":"2020-12-16T16:03:45.000Z","id":"reckCbf2xsPbzSaWi"},{"title":"Outside Podcast","media":"Podcast","date":"2020-12-15","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://www.outsideonline.com/podcasts","episode":"Tim Cook on Health and Fitness","duration":3960,"created_time":"2020-12-16T16:03:45.000Z","id":"recqO8qBJ3lRBa7QW"},{"title":"Come On Down","media":"Podcast","date":"2020-12-15","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://www.comeondownshow.com","episode":"I’ve Got A Secret","duration":3480,"created_time":"2020-12-16T16:03:45.000Z","id":"recu77Nlk22yDZqH7"},{"title":"The Shotgun Start","media":"Podcast","date":"2020-12-14","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-shotgun-start/id1435273901","episode":"Boom Times on Westy Island, Women’s Open coverage and mudball drama","duration":2640,"created_time":"2020-12-16T16:03:45.000Z","id":"recM2pVHFv4ignpBG"},{"title":"Bill Gates and Rashida Jones Ask Big Questions","media":"Podcast","date":"2020-12-14","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://www.gatesnotes.com/podcast","episode":"5: Can people really change?","duration":3060,"created_time":"2020-12-16T16:03:45.000Z","id":"recPUt3AnJUBPFSxl"},{"title":"TrapDraw","media":"Podcast","date":"2020-12-14","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://nolayingup.com/podcasts/no-laying-up-podcast?page=1","episode":"111: H-Town, HEB, F1, and More!","duration":3900,"created_time":"2020-12-16T16:03:45.000Z","id":"recPWYHKuakZIVdWB"},{"title":"Accidental Tech Podcast","media":"Podcast","date":"2020-12-14","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://atp.fm","episode":"407: It Isn’t a Big Grapefruit","duration":2400,"created_time":"2020-12-16T16:03:45.000Z","id":"recS6lLapyBzyAk25"},{"title":"The Shotgun Start","media":"Podcast","date":"2020-12-14","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-shotgun-start/id1435273901","episode":"Putting a bow on the 2020 major season with U.S. Women’s Open reaction","duration":2220,"created_time":"2020-12-16T16:03:45.000Z","id":"recUxBmFe7KZiCKC0"},{"title":"No Laying Up","media":"Podcast","date":"2020-12-14","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://nolayingup.com/podcasts/no-laying-up-podcast?page=1","episode":"385: U.S. Women’s Open Recap","duration":2340,"created_time":"2020-12-16T16:03:45.000Z","id":"recVAUERrJIjZHq8H"},{"title":"Unbreakable","media":"Movie","date":"2020-12-10","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/unbreakable/","rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-10T16:06:56.000Z","id":"rec3LEk8y6FGZ5Trc"},{"title":"The Flop House","media":"Podcast","date":"2020-12-09","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://www.flophousepodcast.com","episode":"320 - Last Christmas, w/ Hallie Haglund","duration":3720,"created_time":"2020-12-09T16:14:30.000Z","id":"recqxV0Rk8VkQ87bD"},{"title":"The Flop House","media":"Podcast","date":"2020-12-08","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://www.flophousepodcast.com","episode":"320 - Last Christmas, w/ Hallie Haglund","duration":2700,"created_time":"2020-12-09T16:14:32.000Z","id":"rectpGxbpEIl5roLQ"},{"title":"Come On Down","media":"Podcast","date":"2020-12-08","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://www.comeondownshow.com","episode":"Legends of the Hidden Temple","duration":4380,"created_time":"2020-12-09T16:14:32.000Z","id":"recwqpsnrY1oG0XgH"},{"title":"The Shotgun Start","media":"Podcast","date":"2020-12-07","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-shotgun-start/id1435273901","episode":"Frigid under par, a FedEx hitman, and Huh?

Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick)","media":"Book","creator":"Seth Godin","length":108,"year":"2007","date":"2019-08-27","date_updated":"2018-06-28","status":"Complete","summary":"\\## Being the Best in the World Is Seriously Underrated \n\\\u003e Winners quit all the time. They just quit the right stuff at the right time. \n\n\\\u003e It’s called Zipf’s law, and it applies to résumés and college application rates and best-selling records and everything in between. Winners win big because the marketplace loves a winner. \n\n\\\u003e Best is subjective. I (the consumer) get to decide, not you. World is selfish. It’s my definition, not yours. It’s the world I define, based on my convenience or my preferences. Be the best in my world and you have me, at a premium, right now.\n\n\\\u003e How often do you look for someone who is actually quite good at the things you don’t need her to do? How often do you hope that your accountant is a safe driver and a decent golfer? In a free market, we reward the exceptional. \n\n\\\u003e In fact, the people who are the best in the world specialize at getting really good at the questions they don’t know. The people who skip the hard questions are in the majority, but they are not in demand. \n\n\\\u003e The Dip is the long slog between starting and mastery. A long slog that’s actually a shortcut, because it gets you where you want to go faster than any other path.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e The Dip is the long stretch between beginner’s luck and real accomplishment. \n\n\\\u003e Your marketplace is competitive, filled with people overcoming challenges every day. It’s the incredibly difficult challenges (the Dips) that give you the opportunity to pull ahead. \n\n\\\u003e In a competitive world, adversity is your ally. The harder it gets, the better chance you have of insulating yourself from the competition. If that adversity also causes you to quit, though, it’s all for nothing. \n\n\\\u003e And yet the real success goes to those who obsess. The focus that leads you through the Dip to the other side is rewarded by a marketplace in search of the best in the world. A woodpecker can tap twenty times on a thousand trees and get nowhere, but stay busy. Or he can tap twenty-thousand times on one tree and get dinner. \n\n\\\u003e It’s easier to be mediocre than it is to confront reality and quit. \n\n\\\u003e Simple: If you can’t make it through the Dip, don’t start. \n\n\\\u003e If you want to be a superstar, then you need to find a field with a steep Dip—a barrier between those who try and those who succeed. And you’ve got to get through that Dip to the other side. This isn’t for everyone. If it were, there’d be no superstars. If you choose this path, it’s because you realize that there’s a Dip, and you believe you can get through it. The Dip is actually your greatest ally because it makes the project worthwhile (and keeps others from competing with you).\n\n\\\u003e Seven Reasons You Might Fail to Become the Best in the World You run out of time (and quit). You run out of money (and quit). You get scared (and quit). You’re not serious about it (and quit). You lose interest or enthusiasm or settle for being mediocre (and quit). You focus on the short term instead of the long (and quit when the short term gets too hard). You pick the wrong thing at which to be the best in the world (because you don’t have the talent). \n\n\\\u003e Whatever you do for a living, or for fun, it’s probably somehow based on a system that’s based on quitting. Quitting creates scarcity; scarcity creates value. \n\n\\\u003e The next time you catch yourself being average when you feel like quitting, realize that you have only two good choices: Quit or be exceptional. Average is for losers. \n\n\\\u003e The marketers who get rewarded are the ones who don’t quit. They hunker down through the Dip and galvanize and insulate and perfect their product while others keep looking for yet another quick hit.\n","method":["Digital"],"rating":"★★★☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recmRqagVLaPc2KQ8"},{"title":"The Hustle","media":"Movie","date":"2019-08-24","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-hustle-2019/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"rec5VKHehiWTGJ03O"},{"title":"Pokémon Detective Pikachu","media":"Movie","date":"2019-08-23","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/pokemon-detective-pikachu/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"rec5gaQ0pJGCpshYw"},{"title":"Driven","media":"Movie","date":"2019-08-22","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/driven-2019/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recIXg2Oj8Dt46ITB"},{"title":"Shazam!","media":"Movie","date":"2019-08-05","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/shazam/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recKbeZGdEjG2NGdE"},{"title":"Long Shot","media":"Movie","date":"2019-08-02","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/long-shot-2019/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recQw0YE5dEcm0edg"},{"title":"Golf Architecture (Annotated): Economy in Course Construction and Green-Keeping","media":"Book","creator":"Alister Mackenzie","length":104,"year":"1920","date":"2019-06-21","date_updated":"2019-04-11","status":"Complete","summary":"\\## Chapter I\n\n\\\u003eThe chief object of every golf architect or green - keeper worth his salt is to imitate the beauties of nature so closely as to make his work indistinguishable from nature itself.\n\n\\\u003eMost golfers have an entirely erroneous view of the real object of hazards. The majority of them simply look upon hazards as a means of punishing a bad shot, when their real object is to make the game interesting.\n\n\\## Chapter III\n\n\\\u003eThe ideal hole is surely one that affords the greatest pleasure to the greatest number, gives the fullest advantage for accurate play, stimulates players to improve their game, and never becomes monotonous.\n\n\\\u003eWhy should not even an open champion occasionally have a shot that the long handicap man is frequently compelled to play?\n\n\\\u003eIn an ideal long hole, there should not only be a big advantage from successfully negotiating a long carry for the tee shot, but the longer the drive, the greater the advantage should be. A shorter driver should also, by extreme accuracy, be able to gain an advantage over a long hitting but less accurate opponent.\n\n\\\u003eAn ideal hole should provide an infinite variety of shots according to the varying positions of the tee, the situation of the flag, the direction and strength of the wind, etc. It should also at times give full advantage for the voluntary pull or slice, one of the most finished shots in golf, and one that few champions are able to carry out with any great degree of accuracy.\n\n\\## Chapter IV\n\n\\\u003eComparing the small amount of land utilised for golf with the large amount devoted to agriculture, we get infinitely more value out of the former than the latter. We all eat too much.

The club was established in 1893 after Theodore Havemeyer, whose family owned the American Sugar Refining Company, convinced some of the wealthiest men in America at the time—John Jacob Astor, Perry Belmont, and Cornelius Vanderbilt—to purchase a 140-acre farm overlooking the ocean. Two years later, in 1895, the Newport Country Club hosted the first US Amateur Championship and the first US Open. For the one-hundredth anniversary of the US Amateur, the tournament had returned to its birthplace. \n\n\\\u003e When he was handed the Havemeyer Trophy, Tiger smiled and held it over his head. “This one should be dedicated to the Brunza family,” he said, turning toward his caddie. “This one’s for you, Jay.” \n\n\\## Chapter 11: Masterful\n\n\\\u003e Tiger hadn’t been the only world-class athlete to make his professional debut in 1996. Eighteen-year-old Kobe Bryant joined the Los Angeles Lakers; twenty-two-year-old Derek Jeter started with the New York Yankees; and fourteen-year-old Serena Williams had played in her first professional tennis tournament at the end of 1995. Each would go on to become superstars in their respective sports. \n\n\\\u003e Smith’s story—“ The Chosen One”—would go down in the annals of sports journalism as one of the most heartfelt cautionary profiles of a modern-day athlete. \n\n\\\u003e He wasn’t interested in whether it was realistic. He was driven by the impossible. \n\n\\## Chapter 12: Mania\n\n\\\u003e Tiger piled into a Cadillac courtesy car with his mom and his friends, popped in a CD by the hip-hop group Quad City DJ’s, cranked up “C’mon N’ Ride It (The Train)” to full blast, and drove down Magnolia Lane with the windows down. No Masters winner had ever left Augusta in such style. \n\n\\## Chapter 21: Changes II\n\n\\\u003e Nike had recently shipped a box of prototype titanium drivers to Woods so he could test them. There were six in total. After putting the drivers through their paces, Tiger told Devlin that he preferred the one that was heavier than the others. Devlin informed him that all six drivers were the exact same weight. Tiger argued otherwise, insisting that one weighed more than the others. To prove him wrong, Devlin sent the drivers back to the design wizards at the Nike testing facility in Fort Worth with instructions to weigh them. They found that five drivers were exactly the same weight, but the sixth was two grams heavier. When they pulled the club apart, they discovered that an extra dab of goo had been added to the inside of the head by one of the engineers to help absorb a few floating particles of titanium. The weight of the goo was equivalent to the weight of two one-dollar bills. Yet Tiger noticed the difference in the way the driver felt in his hands. \n\n\\## Chapter 23: Loss\n\n\\\u003e But his iron play in particular was what separated him from everyone else. “In 2006, Tiger was eight feet four inches better than the Tour average with his irons,” explained Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee. \n\n\\## Chapter 25: It’s Just Pain\n\n\\\u003e There’s a difference between being hurt and being injured. If I’m hurt, I can deal with pain. Pain is no big deal. I can block that out. But when I’m injured, my body doesn’t respond. \n\n\\## Chapter 28: Firestorm\n\n\\\u003e For twenty-one consecutive days, Tiger appeared on the cover of the New York Post, surpassing the previous record of twenty consecutive covers devoted to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. \n\n\\## Chapter 35: Making the Cut\n\n\\\u003e Rickie Fowler had three PGA Tour wins at age twenty-seven. Tiger had thirty-four at the same age. It took Jordan Spieth 112 Tour starts to get his tenth win. Tiger got there in 63. Dustin Johnson won his only major at age thirty-one. At the same age, Tiger had won twelve. \n\n","method":["Digital"],"rating":"★★★★★","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recuaRE4RVjQtdsds"},{"title":"Vice","media":"Movie","date":"2018-12-27","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/vice-2018/","rating":"★★☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recki3BKt8QW6qLZR"},{"title":"Furious 7","media":"Movie","date":"2018-12-24","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/furious-7/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recRvGHpjl1j3dlcA"},{"title":"Office Christmas Party","media":"Movie","date":"2018-12-23","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/office-christmas-party/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recyXy1idFRPZPJQR"},{"title":"Heat","media":"Movie","date":"2018-12-18","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/heat-1995/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recoywWAk7p3pomny"},{"title":"Navy SEAL Dogs: My Tale of Training Canines for Combat","media":"Book","creator":"Michael Ritland","length":205,"year":"2013","date":"2018-12-17","date_updated":"2018-11-14","status":"Complete","summary":"\\## Part I: Navy SEALS and Dogs \n\\### 3.

Ever. \n\n\\## Part II: On Making the Grade \n\\### 5. Not Your Typical House Pet\n\n\\\u003e The dogs that we procure and train for the SEALs are all herding dogs—pointy-eared shepherds, usually Dutch Shepherds or Belgian Malinois. \n\n\\\u003e The dropout/ failure rate among humans who want to qualify as Navy SEALs is very high. The rate among the dogs we select and train is even higher. \n\n\\\u003e Dogs are legendary, and for good reason, for the sensitivity of their noses. Scientists estimate that, on average, a dog has 220 million scent receptors in its nose. The average person has 5 million. \n\n\\### 6. Well Trained\n\\\u003e One simple thing I do to establish that bond and their association with me as a source of positive things is to feed them and give them water myself. \n\n\\\u003e Repetition is a key part of how dogs learn through association. \n\n\\\u003e Praise is essential to getting these dogs—or any dog, for that matter—to do what you want. Praise can come in the form of words or a treat or anything that the dog sees as positive. \n\n\\\u003e One of the most frequent mistakes I see people make with their dogs is that when “correcting” them, they get the dogs to stop doing what they didn’t want them to do and then continue to berate or punish the dog anyway. That’s incredibly confusing for a dog. \n","method":["Digital"],"rating":"★★★☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recuaLImS0mzNrrFo"},{"title":"Roma","media":"Movie","date":"2018-12-17","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/roma-2018/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recH3hYlASHoDbt8Q"},{"title":"Game Over, Man!","media":"Movie","date":"2018-12-17","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/game-over-man/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recNLK3ZHfp7MDnNn"},{"title":"Mission: Impossible - Fallout","media":"Movie","date":"2018-12-11","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/mission-impossible-fallout/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recN13qYmueQZM68c"},{"title":"Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs","media":"Audiobook","creator":"Ken Kocienda","length":264,"year":"2018","date":"2018-12-08","date_updated":"2018-12-05","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","method":["Audiobook"],"isbn":"1250194466","isbn13":9781250194466,"rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"rec5NN7NV95TriFFp"},{"title":"All the President's Men","media":"Movie","date":"2018-12-05","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/all-the-presidents-men/","rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"reco6DM0UJiNJHP52"},{"title":"Bohemian Rhapsody","media":"Movie","date":"2018-12-05","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/bohemian-rhapsody/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"rec6OnxTb7l6LDf0r"},{"title":"The Machinist","media":"Movie","date":"2018-11-29","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-machinist/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recRve2OIYYXDW7PU"},{"title":"12 Angry Men","media":"Movie","date":"2018-11-27","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/12-angry-men/","rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recBQD8rArCyDyKLx"},{"title":"BlacKkKlansman","media":"Movie","date":"2018-11-13","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/blackkklansman/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recdNdYIPmWzn3J8c"},{"title":"Eighth Grade","media":"Movie","date":"2018-11-09","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/eighth-grade/","rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recKo887XWTW8J9Cn"},{"title":"Sorry to Bother You","media":"Movie","date":"2018-11-09","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/sorry-to-bother-you/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recm8x5ROcEpGX0rf"},{"title":"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time","media":"Book","creator":"Mark Haddon","length":240,"year":"2003","date":"2018-10-09","date_updated":"2017-01-22","status":"Complete","summary":"\\\u003eAlso, dogs are faithful and they do not tell lies because they cannot talk. \n\n\\\u003eI also said that I cared about dogs because they were faithful and honest, and some dogs were cleverer and more interesting than some people. Steve, for example, who comes to the school on Thursdays, needs help to eat his food and could not even fetch a stick. Siobhan asked me not to say this to Steve’s mother. \n\n\\\u003eI sometimes think of my mind as a machine, but not always as a bread-slicing machine. It makes it easier to explain to other people what is going on inside it. \n\n\\\u003eBut I don’t take any notice because I don’t listen to what other people say and only sticks and stones can break my bones and I have my Swiss Army knife if they hit me and if I kill them it will be self-defense and I won’t go to prison. \n\n\\\u003eIntuition can sometimes get things wrong. And intuition is what people use in life to make decisions.

It’s my own rule that I call the “three-hour rule.” You take three hours a day for yourself to do what YOU want to do. That time is cumulative. It can be going for a walk, watching TV, reading, whatever. But when you’re in that time you don’t feel guilty that you’re not with your family, at work, or doing something else. If you don’t take time for yourself—you’ll resent the people who are taking those things away from you.\n\n\\## DAY 3 The Distractor \n\\\u003eThe monks first book (they have a bunch of them), first published in 1978, is called How to Be Your Dog’s Best Friend.

They say that’s the best way to learn. My wife always tells her employees, “If nobody told you how to do your job, how would you do it?” The results she gets from that are amazing. Sometimes you have to rip up the playbook, break the mold, and do it your own way.\n\n\\\u003eAfter the chanting and reflections around Jesus, today’s theme for service was forgiveness. It’s something I struggle with. It’s not that I live with a lot of resentments, but I have a hard time of letting go when I feel like I’ve been wronged or betrayed. So it really hit home when Brother Christopher explained that forgiveness was the answer to wasted energy. I really got it. But I’m still pissed at a few people.\n\n\\\u003eThe checklist behind a Krav Maga first strike boils down to three basic elements: One, has someone violated your space? Two, is there a direct threat?

In every waking hour we are being triggered by people, events, and circumstances that have the potential to change us. \n\n\\## Part One: Why Don’t We Become the Person We Want to Be? \n\\### Chapter 1: The Immutable Truths of Behavioral Change\n\\\u003e One of the central tenets of this book is that our behavior is shaped, both positively and negatively, by our environment—and that a keen appreciation of our environment can dramatically lift not only our motivation, ability, and understanding of the change process, but also our confidence that we can actually do it. \n\n\\\u003e It’s just you and your habit, a lone individual dealing with one demon. You either lick it or you don’t. It’s up to you—and only you—to declare victory. No one else gets a say in the matter. \n\n\\\u003e Relying on other people increases the degree of difficulty exponentially. \n\n\\## Chapter 2: Belief Triggers That Stop Behavioral Change in Its Tracks\n\\\u003e An excuse explains why we fell short of expectations after the fact. Our inner beliefs trigger failure before it happens. They sabotage lasting change by canceling its possibility. We employ these beliefs as articles of faith to justify our inaction and then wish away the result. I call them belief triggers. \n\n\\\u003e We deify willpower and self-control, and mock its absence. People who achieve through remarkable willpower are “strong” and “heroic.” People who need help or structure are “weak.” This is crazy—because few of us can accurately gauge or predict our willpower. We not only overestimate it, we chronically underestimate the power of triggers in our environment to lead us astray. Our environment is a magnificent willpower-reduction machine. \n\n\\\u003e If we really want to change we have to make peace with the fact that we cannot self-exempt every time the calendar offers us a more attractive alternative to our usual day. Excusing our momentary lapses as an outlier event triggers a self-indulgent inconsistency—which is fatal for change. Successful change doesn’t happen overnight. We’re playing a long game, not the short game of instant gratification that our special day provides. \n\n\\\u003e When we presume that we are better than people who need structure and guidance, we lack one of the most crucial ingredients for change: humility. \n\n\\\u003e Fairy tales end with “and they lived happily ever after.” That is why they are called fairy tales, not documentaries. \n\n\\\u003e Getting better is its own reward. \n\n\\\u003e While our slow and steady improvement may not be as obvious to others as it is to us, when we revert to our previous behavior, people always notice. \n\n\\## Chapter 3: It’s the Environment\n\\\u003e We think we are in sync with our environment, but actually it’s at war with us. We think we control our environment but in fact it controls us. We think our external environment is conspiring in our favor—that is, helping us—when actually it is taxing and draining us. It is not interested in what it can give us. It’s only interested in what it can take from us. \n\n\\\u003e Our environment is a nonstop triggering mechanism whose impact on our behavior is too significant to be ignored. \n\n\\\u003e We put off going to bed at the intended time because we prefer to remain in our current environment.\n\n\\## Chapter 4: Identifying Our Triggers \n\\\u003e Slowly it dawns on them how profoundly the environment affects behavior. \n\n\\\u003e A feedback loop comprises four stages: evidence, relevance, consequence, and action. \n\n\\\u003e What if we could control our environment so it triggered our most desired behavior—like an elegantly designed feedback loop? Instead of blocking us from our goals, this environment propels us. Instead of dulling us to our surroundings, it sharpens us. Instead of shutting down who we are, it opens us. \n\n\\\u003e A behavioral trigger is any stimulus that impacts our behavior. \n\n\\\u003e External triggers come from the environment, bombarding our five senses as well as our minds. Internal triggers come from thoughts or feelings that are not connected with any outside stimulus. \n\n\\\u003e Triggers are not inherently “good” or “bad.” What matters is our response to them. \n\n\\## Chapter 7: Forecasting the Environment \\\\\u003e %% Page 73 · %% Location1246\n\\\u003e Forecasting is what we must do after acknowledging the environment’s power over us. It comprises three interconnected stages: anticipation, avoidance, and adjustment. \n\n\\\u003e Peter Drucker famously said, “Half the leaders I have met don’t need to learn what to do. They need to learn what to stop.” \n\n\\\u003e This impulse to always engage rather than selectively avoid is one reason I’m called in to coach executives on their behavior. It’s one of the most common behavioral issues among leaders: succumbing to the temptation to exercise power when they would be better off showing restraint. \n\n\\\u003e To avoid undesirable behavior, avoid the environments where it is most likely to occur. \n\n\\## Chapter 8: The Wheel of Change \\\\\u003e %% Page 87 · %% Location1415\n\\\u003e Creating is the glamorous poster child of behavioral change. When we imagine ourselves behaving better, we think of it as an exciting process of self-invention. We’re creating a “new me.” It’s appealing and seductive. We can be anyone we choose to be. The challenge is to do it by choice, not as a bystander. Are we creating ourselves, or wasting the opportunity and being created by external forces instead? \n\n\\## Part Two: Try\n\\## Chapter 11: Daily Questions in Action\n\\\u003e Self-discipline refers to achieving desirable behavior. Self-control refers to avoiding undesirable behavior. \n\n\\## Chapter 12: Planner, Doer, and Coach\n\\\u003e But beyond the structured hierarchies of the workplace, where we’re always answerable to someone for our paycheck and where we have clear incentives for getting better, we don’t appreciate the dynamic as well. In our private lives, where our chaotic environment triggers undesirable behavior, we don’t always welcome coaching. \n\n\\## Chapter 13: AIWATT\n\\\u003e Am I willing, at this time, to make the investment required to make a positive difference on this topic? \n\n\\\u003e Don Corleone, the Godfather, must have been a closet Buddhist when he said, “It’s not personal. It’s business.” He knew that people disappoint us or disagree with us when it’s in their best interest to do so, not because they want to cause us pain. \n\n\\## Part Three: More Structure, Please\n\\## Chapter 16: Behaving Under the Influence of Depletion\n\\\u003e By the end of the day, we’re worn down and vulnerable to foolish choices. \n\n\\\u003e Researchers call this decision fatigue, a state that leaves us with two courses of action: 1) we make careless choices or 2) we surrender to the status quo and do nothing. \n\n\\\u003e Structure is how we overcome depletion. In an almost magical way, structure slows down how fast our discipline and self-control disappear. When we have structure, we don’t have to make as many choices; we just follow the plan. And the net result is we’re not being depleted as quickly. \n\n\\## Chapter 18: Hourly Questions\n\\\u003e Pre-awareness. Successful people are generally good at anticipating environments where their best behavior is at risk. \n \n\\\u003e Commitment. Successful people aren’t wishy-washy about a course of action. \n\n\\\u003e Awareness. We’re most vulnerable to our environment’s whims when we ignore its impact on us. \n\n\\## Chapter 19: The Trouble with “Good Enough”\n\\\u003e Marginal motivation produces a marginal outcome. \n\n\\\u003e The takeaway: We are professionals at what we do, amateurs at what we want to become. We need to erase this devious distinction—or at least close the gap between professional and amateur—to become the person we want to be. Being good over here does not excuse being not so good over there. \n\n\\## Chapter 20: Becoming the Trigger\n\\\u003e When we dive all the way into adult behavioral change—with 100 percent focus and energy—we become an irresistible force rather than the proverbial immovable object. We begin to change our environment rather than be changed by it. The people around us sense this. We have become the trigger. \n\n\\\u003e “What’s the biggest behavioral change you’ve ever made?” \n\n\\\u003e The pain that comes with regret should be mandatory, not something to be shooed away like an annoying pet. When we make bad choices and fail ourselves or hurt the people we love, we should feel pain. That pain can be motivating and in the best sense, triggering—a reminder that maybe we messed up but we can do better. It’s one of the most powerful feelings guiding us to change. \n\n\\## Vocabulary\n\n\\- Monastic - relating to monks, nuns, or others living under religious vows, or the buildings in which they live\n\n\\- Droll - curious or unusual in a way that provokes dry amusement\n\n\\- Convivial - (of an atmosphere or event) friendly, lively, and enjoyable\n\n\\- Anodyne - not likely to provoke dissent or offense; inoffensive, often deliberately so\n\n\\- Mollifying - appease the anger or anxiety of (someone)\n\n\\- Stultifying - cause to lose enthusiasm and initiative, especially as a result of a tedious or restrictive routine\n","method":["Digital"],"rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recQP7gYNd4RcXXY9"},{"title":"Homo Deus: A History of Tomorrow","media":"Audiobook","creator":"Yuval Noah Harari","length":450,"year":"2017","date":"2018-05-03","date_updated":"2017-12-18","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","method":["Audiobook"],"rating":"★★★★★","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recZh8jj2nr9Xsgbt"},{"title":"Avengers: Infinity War","media":"Movie","date":"2018-05-02","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/avengers-infinity-war/","rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"reccR4XdTzfCrOPx3"},{"title":"The Greatest Showman","media":"Movie","date":"2018-04-16","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-greatest-showman/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"rec5lUmuYSoMLZVDx"},{"title":"Molly's Game","media":"Movie","date":"2018-04-07","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/mollys-game/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recWBXrql7NoAliv2"},{"title":"Black Panther","media":"Movie","date":"2018-03-28","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/black-panther-2018/","rating":"★★★★★","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recXvhXEE5a2QZclK"},{"title":"When We First Met","media":"Movie","date":"2018-03-17","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/when-we-first-met/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"reczgOYw3TEiZnY0D"},{"title":"Oblivion","media":"Movie","date":"2018-03-09","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/oblivion-2013/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"reccU8D12PV25a7bn"},{"title":"Thor: Ragnarok","media":"Movie","date":"2018-03-09","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/thor-ragnarok/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recRdivGynaz33rZa"},{"title":"Call Me by Your Name","media":"Movie","date":"2018-03-03","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/call-me-by-your-name/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recIGqeJv4cCY3Dz9"},{"title":"Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood","media":"Audiobook","creator":"Trevor Noah","length":289,"year":"2016","date":"2018-03-01","date_updated":"2018-02-01","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","method":["Audiobook"],"isbn":"0385689225","isbn13":9780385689229,"rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"rec9QvEU7xshorPd8"},{"title":"Darkest Hour","media":"Movie","date":"2018-02-27","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/darkest-hour/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recSQ5BVjjKl0Scr7"},{"title":"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","media":"Movie","date":"2018-02-24","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recgFL1r2X04GIhA9"},{"title":"Ghostbusters","media":"Movie","date":"2018-02-22","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/ghostbusters-2016/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recjgHIaxsogCAGWu"},{"title":"Man's Search for Meaning","media":"Book","creator":"Viktor E. Frankl","length":188,"year":"1946","date":"2018-02-20","date_updated":"2016-12-10","status":"Complete","summary":"\\## I: Experiences in a Concentration Camp \n\\\u003eIf someone now asked of us the truth of Dostoevski’s statement that flatly defines man as a being who can get used to anything, we would reply, “Yes, a man can get used to anything, but do not ask us how.” \n\n\\\u003eAn abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal behavior.\n\n\\\u003eDisgust, horror and pity are emotions that our spectator could not really feel any more.\n\n\\\u003eApathy, the blunting of the emotions and the feeling that one could not care any more, were the symptoms arising during the second stage of the prisoner’s psychological reactions, and which eventually made him insensitive to daily and hourly beatings. \n\n\\\u003eSensitive people who were used to a rich intellectual life may have suffered much pain (they were often of a delicate constitution), but the damage to their inner selves was less. They were able to retreat from their terrible surroundings to a life of inner riches and spiritual freedom. Only in this way can one explain the apparent paradox that some prisoners of a less hardy make-up often seemed to survive camp life better than did those of a robust nature.\n\n\\\u003eThe attempt to develop a sense of humor and to see things in a humorous light is some kind of a trick learned while mastering the art of living. \n\n\\\u003eAs I have mentioned before, we had no documents; everyone was lucky to own his body, which, after all, was still breathing. \n\n\\\u003eBesides these physical causes, there were mental ones, in the form of certain complexes. The majority of prisoners suffered from a kind of inferiority complex. We all had once been or had fancied ourselves to be “somebody.” Now we were treated like complete nonentities. (The consciousness of one’s inner value is anchored in higher, more spiritual things, and cannot be shaken by camp life. But how many free men, let alone prisoners, possess it?) Without consciously thinking about it, the average prisoner felt himself utterly degraded. \n\n\\\u003eEverything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way. \n\n\\\u003eIf there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.\n\n\\\u003eThe way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity—even under the most difficult circumstances—to add a deeper meaning to his life. It may remain brave, dignified and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal. Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not. \n\n\\\u003eEmotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it. \n\n\\\u003eLife ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual. \n\n\\\u003eWhen a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task; his single and unique task. He will have to acknowledge the fact that even in suffering he is unique and alone in the universe. No one can relieve him of his suffering or suffer in his place. His unique opportunity lies in the way in which he bears his burden. \n\n\\\u003e(What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you.)\n\n\\## II: Logotherapy in a Nutshell \n\\\u003eThere is nothing in the world, I venture to say, that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions as the knowledge that there is a meaning in one’s life. \n\n\\\u003eWhat man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task. \n\n\\\u003eOne should not search for an abstract meaning of life. Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Thus, everyone’s task is as unique as is his specific opportunity to implement it. \n\n\\\u003eThis emphasis on responsibleness is reflected in the categorical imperative of logotherapy, which is: “Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!” It seems to me that there is nothing which would stimulate a man’s sense of responsibleness more than this maxim, which invites him to imagine first that the present is past and, second, that the past may yet be changed and amended. Such a precept confronts him with life’s finiteness as well as the finality of what he makes out of both his life and himself. \n\n\\\u003eThe second way of finding a meaning in life is by experiencing something—such as goodness, truth and beauty—by experiencing nature and culture or, last but not least, by experiencing another human being in his very uniqueness—by loving him. \n\n\\\u003eIn some way, suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice. \n\n\\\u003ePleasure is, and must remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and spoiled to the degree to which it is made a goal in itself. \n\n\\\u003eAs for the actual causation of neuroses, apart from constitutional elements, whether somatic or psychic in nature, such feedback mechanisms as anticipatory anxiety seem to be a major pathogenic factor. A given symptom is responded to by a phobia, the phobia triggers the symptom, and the symptom, in turn, reinforces the phobia. \n\n\\\u003eMan does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment.\n\n\\\u003eBy the same token, every human being has the freedom to change at any instant. Therefore, we can predict his future only within the large framework of a statistical survey referring to a whole group; the individual personality, however, remains essentially unpredictable. The basis for any predictions would be represented by biological, psychological or sociological conditions. Yet one of the main features of human existence is the capacity to rise above such conditions, to grow beyond them. Man is capable of changing the world for the better if possible, and of changing himself for the better if necessary. \n\n\\\u003eAfter all, man is that being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord’s Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips. \n\n\\## The Case for a Tragic Optimism \n\\\u003eAs logotherapy teaches, there are three main avenues on which one arrives at meaning in life. The first is by creating a work or by doing a deed. The second is by experiencing something or encountering someone; in other words, meaning can be found not only in work but also in love.\n\n\\\u003eMost important, however, is the third avenue to meaning in life: even the helpless victim of a hopeless situation, facing a fate he cannot change, may rise above himself, may grow beyond himself, and by so doing change himself. He may turn a personal tragedy into a triumph.\n\n\\## Vocabulary\n\n\\- Perdition - a state of eternal punishment and damnation into which a sinful and unpenitent person passes after death.\n\\- Incorrigible - (of a person or their tendencies) not able to be corrected, improved, or reformed\n\\- Panacea - a solution or remedy for all difficulties or diseases\n","method":["Digital"],"rating":"★★★★★","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"reci6JAsyAEZukpZn"},{"title":"Logan","media":"Movie","date":"2018-02-01","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/logan-2017/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recxefN8W3smeNC7o"},{"title":"Blade Runner 2049","media":"Movie","date":"2018-01-23","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/blade-runner-2049/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recnpRNgXRrIfXu0H"},{"title":"The Killing of a Sacred Deer","media":"Movie","date":"2018-01-20","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-killing-of-a-sacred-deer/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recunOqbpcqIehDUw"},{"title":"American Made","media":"Movie","date":"2018-01-12","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/american-made/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recgHBdMcYbhByGvF"},{"title":"Kingsman: The Golden Circle","media":"Movie","date":"2018-01-12","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/kingsman-the-golden-circle/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recSauPpypkXpzOlh"},{"title":"The Room","media":"Movie","date":"2018-01-03","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-room/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recPekM3LLpDq9hC6"},{"title":"7 Days Out","media":"TV","date":"2018-01-01","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","season":"Season 1","rating":"★★★☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:33:35.000Z","id":"recKgndLQSD5tQ0Lp"},{"title":"Ingrid Goes West","media":"Movie","date":"2017-12-29","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/ingrid-goes-west/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recCBb3EWkWZoCMnm"},{"title":"mother!","media":"Movie","date":"2017-12-27","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/mother-2017/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recWedMLQyFhXGnHI"},{"title":"The Night Before","media":"Movie","date":"2017-12-26","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-night-before-2015/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"rec6I42HPm9PFYWZ1"},{"title":"Pan's Labyrinth","media":"Movie","date":"2017-12-23","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/pans-labyrinth/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recrv6X3zqtAmEt8L"},{"title":"Star Wars: The Last Jedi","media":"Movie","date":"2017-12-19","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/star-wars-the-last-jedi/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"rec6WYQfdcP542UXT"},{"title":"The Devil in the White City","media":"Audiobook","creator":"Erik Larson","length":447,"year":"2003","date":"2017-12-15","date_updated":"2016-07-19","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","method":["Audiobook"],"isbn":"0739303406","isbn13":9780739303405,"rating":"★★★☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recqGDI23uqfoy25y"},{"title":"Split","media":"Movie","date":"2017-12-05","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/split-2016/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recB5MhNNwalwIrfT"},{"title":"The Magnificent Seven","media":"Movie","date":"2017-12-05","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-magnificent-seven-2016/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"reciLA0aELmjWBSUL"},{"title":"The Internet of Money","media":"Book","creator":"Andreas M. Antonopoulos","length":150,"year":"2016","date":"2017-12-04","date_updated":"2017-11-16","status":"Complete","summary":"\\## 1. What Is Bitcoin?\n\\\u003e Bitcoin is a technology, it is a currency, and it is an international network of payments and exchange that is completely decentralized. It doesn’t rely on banks. It doesn’t rely on governments. \n \n\\### 1.2. Money of the People\n\\\u003e Six and a half billion people on this planet have no connection to the world of money. They operate in cash-based societies with very little access to international resources. They don’t need banks. Two billion of these people are already on the internet. With a simple application download, they can immediately become participants in an international economy, using an international currency that can be transmitted anywhere with no fees and no government controls. They can connect to a world of international finance that is completely peer-to-peer. Bitcoin is the money of the people. At its center are simple mathematical rules that everyone agrees on and no one controls. \n \n\\### 1.6. Programmable Money for All of Us\n\\\u003e Bitcoin is the internet of money. Currency is only the first application. If you grasp that, you can look beyond the price, you can look beyond the volatility, you can look beyond the fad. At its core, bitcoin is a revolutionary technology that will change the world forever. \n \n\\## 2. Peer-to-Peer Money\n\\### 2.1. How Old Is Money?\n\\\u003e One thing that surprises people is that money is older than writing. We know this because when we look at archeological discoveries of writing, we find hieroglyphics and we find cuneiform. When we look at all of these ancient forms of writing, guess what they’re writing about. Money. They’re writing ledgers. All of the ancient writing we find, the first forms of writing, are ledgers. They are writing about money. Because money is older than writing.\n \n\\\u003e I think the important insight into the nature of money is that money is a form of communication. At its very basic level, money isn’t value. Money represents an abstraction of value; it’s a way of communicating value. It’s a language.\n \n\\\u003e We use money to communicate value to each other, to express to each other how much we value a product, a service, a gesture. \n \n\\### 2.2.1. Barter to Precious Metals\n\\\u003e The first major transformational technology moment for money was when money stopped being about the tangible consumption of intrinsic value, but became something that referred to value, as an abstraction. \n \n\\### 2.3. Moving to a Network-Centric, Protocol-Based Era\n\\\u003e Bitcoin is the first network-centric, protocol-based form of money. That means it exists without reference to an institutional or platform context. \n \n\\### 2.3.2. Client-Server Architecture\n\\\u003e How many of you have money in a bank? None of you has money in a bank. Do you store physical money in a safe deposit box? If so, maybe then you could say you have money in a bank. The rest of you have loaned your money to a bank. For the privilege of loaning your money to a bank, you will be paid the amazing interest rate of 0.00001 percent per year. Your bank will take that money, turn around, and loan it to the people standing next to you for 24.99 percent APR.\n \n\\## 3. Privacy, Identity, Surveillance and Money\n\\### 3.4. New Architecture, New Access\n\\\u003e Imagine a world where every person has the ability not only to execute transactions but also to create complex financial systems and instruments without asking for anyone’s permission. Simply by connecting to the network, anyone can start a new application. \n \n\\### 3.6. Network-Centric Money\n\\\u003e Bitcoin isn’t a digital currency. It’s a cryptocurrency. It’s a network-centric money. I really like the idea of a network-centric money. A network that allows you to replace trust in institutions, trust in hierarchies, with trust on the network. The network acting as a massively diffuse arbiter of truth, resolving any disagreements about transactions and security in a way where no one has control. \n \n\\### 3.8. Sousveillance, Not Surveillance\n\\\u003e What is the difference between privacy and secrecy? Ultimately, and practically in today’s vocabulary, privacy is the right of billions of individuals to not be surveilled. Secrecy is the power of the very few to escape accountability, to have no transparency.\n \n\\\u003e We live in a world where every individual transaction you do through the financial system is cataloged, analyzed, and transmitted to intelligence services all around the world that collaborate, and yet we have no idea what our governments do with money. The financial systems of the powerful are completely opaque. Our transactions are completely visible through this system of surveillance. This world is upside down. Bitcoin rights it.\n \n\\\u003e We need to live in a world where secrecy is fickle and easily pierced, where power has to face accountability because they are under the spotlight of transparency.\n \n\\## 4. Innovators, Disruptors, Misfits, and Bitcoin\n\\### 4.3. Incumbent Reactions to Innovation\n\\\u003e In a world of tinkers, of experimenters, of makers, open wins. The reason it wins is that it allows innovation to flourish at the edges. \n \n\\### 4.4. Open Innovation and Opt-In Systems\n\\\u003e Bitcoin is different. The reason it’s different is not because we’ve suddenly found the most honest people in the world. Or because there are no quirks in bitcoin. Or because the network doesn’t get attacked. Bitcoin is different because there are plenty of crooks in bitcoin —the network gets attacked all the time —but it doesn’t depend on access control to remain secure. It depends on a simple mathematical formula of incentives and rewards. In order to participate in the bitcoin network and secure the network as a miner, which is a special function in bitcoin, you have to use a lot of computing power and spend a lot of electricity. If you win that competition, you get bitcoin as a reward. That simple equation creates a system of incentives where it’s far better to play with the rules than against the rules. It’s game theory. It’s like a giant game of Sudoku. \n \n\\### 4.6. Remittances, Impacting Lives around the World\n\\\u003e Every day, an immigrant somewhere cashes their paycheck and stands in line to wire 50 percent of that paycheck back to their home country to feed their extended family. Here in the US, 60 million people have no bank accounts, yet they cash their paychecks and send them abroad. Overall in the world, $ 550 billion is transmitted every year as remittances from first-world countries. Much of that money is sent to five major destinations: Mexico, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, and China. In some of these places, remittances represent up to 40 percent of the local economy. Sitting on top of that flow of $ 550 billion are companies like Western Union, and they take, on average, a cut of 9 percent of every single one of these transactions out of the pockets of the poorest people of the world. Imagine what happens when one day one of these immigrants figures out they can do the same thing with bitcoin —not for 15 percent, not 10 percent, not 5 percent, but for 5 cents. Not a percentage; a flat fee. What happens when they can do that? They can, right now. There is a startup company that is handling remittances between the US and the Philippines. They’re doing a few million dollars right now, but they’re going to start growing. There’s $ 500 billion sitting behind that dam. When you’re an immigrant and you can change your financial future by not paying 9 percent to send money home, imagine what happens if every month, instead of sending 91 dollars home, you send 100 dollars home. That makes a difference. There are a billion people, right now, with access to the internet and feature phones who could use bitcoin as an international wire-transfer service. \n \n\\## 5. Dumb Networks, Innovations, and the Festival of Commons\n\\### 5.4. Accelerating Innovation\n\\\u003e That’s why I’m excited to be in the bitcoin space: a dumb network that puts all of the intelligence and innovation at the edge so that we can innovate without asking anyone’s permission, and we can participate in this incredible festival of the commons.\n \n\\## 6. Infrastructure Inversion\n\\### 6.1.1. Infrastructure for Horses\n\\\u003e Looking at that history, one of the really interesting things to me is that in the beginning, the disruptive technology has to live in a world created for the technology it’s replacing. When you first ride your brand new automobile in a city, you are riding on roads used by horses with infrastructure designed and used for horses. \n \n\\### 6.1.2. From Horses to Vehicles\n\\\u003e That’s an infrastructure inversion. You start with the new technology living on the old infrastructure and then, it flips. You build infrastructure and then the old infrastructure rides on top, on the infrastructure designed for the new technology. \n \n\\## 7. Currency as a Language\n\\### 7.2. Currency as a Means of Expression\n\\\u003e You see, money, at the very root of it, is a language. It’s a language we use to express value to each other. When I give you a dollar bill, I am saying that I want to hand you the equivalent value. I’m communicating my desire to exchange value with you, because I appreciate something you can do or something you can give to me. I’m using money as a token of language. \n \n\\### 7.5.1. Multiple Currencies Coexist\n\\\u003e Currency as a means of expression, currency as a tool of language, is no longer up to the issuer. It is up to us as individuals making a choice to use that currency, and we give it value through our use. We give it value through adoption. We will be surprised by some of the currencies that will emerge from a fad, a joke, perhaps even a sick joke, and will explode into viral consciousness on the internet and then become real monetary powers in use across a broad population. \n \n\\## 8. Bitcoin Design Principles\n\\\u003e Bitcoin is digital money. But that doesn’t really capture it. It’s more like the internet of money. But really it’s a consensus decentralized network based on blockchain technology and a proof-of-work algorithm that allows a digital token to act as a reward system for a game-theoretical competition between decentralized miners who validate.\n \n\\### 8.2. Characteristics of Money\n\\\u003e Money itself is an abstraction. If it’s not an abstraction, then it’s not money—it’s barter. If I give you bananas for your goat, that’s not money. Bananas are not money because you eat them. You don’t use them to do further exchanges. Therefore, that’s barter. You’re exchanging one commodity for another. If it’s abstract—if it doesn’t have any practical use in itself—then as an abstraction of money it represents something else, some shared value. \n \n\\### 8.2.1. Just Another Abstraction of Money\n\\\u003e You ask people about bitcoin, and one of the first things I hear from most people is that it’s not real money because it’s not backed by gold like the US dollar—which I find astonishing. The dollar hasn’t been backed by gold since 1936. \n \n\\### 8.3.1. Wallets Aren’t Wallets\n\\\u003e A wallet is something that stores money. Not in bitcoin it isn’t. The money isn’t in the wallet; the money is on the network. The wallet contains keys. So, it’s not a wallet; it’s a keychain. How can you tell it’s not a wallet? Can you copy a wallet? No. But you can copy a key. A keychain is a far better metaphor. If I have a keychain—imagine a big ring of keys like a janitor or a custodian—I have a bunch of keys, and I can go into a shop and have all of those keys duplicated and create a second keychain. Both of those keychains will work interchangeably in all of the locks that the original keychain worked. That’s how a keychain works. If you understand what a keychain does, then you will understand how a bitcoin wallet works. You can copy it, you can make copies of the keys. If you give someone a copy of the key, they can open the door. They don’t need your permission anymore to open the door. \n \n\\### 8.3.2. No Coins in Bitcoin\n\\\u003e Here’s a little secret: there are no coins in bitcoin. When miners mine, they don’t create coins; they create ledger entries. Those ledger entries do not enumerate coins. They have outputs—transaction outputs—which are chunks of value that are infinitely divisible and recombinable. \n \n\\### 8.4.1. Predicting the Future\n\\\u003e They couldn’t possibly predict the outcomes we saw on the internet, because most of the interesting things were not incremental improvements or extensions of the things before. They were radical departures from the past, because they created the conditions for things that were not possible before.\n \n\\\u003e Today, there are 3 billion people with no banking facilities whatsoever. Three billion more people—“ underbanked,” as we call them—without any access to international credit or finance. You or I can go to a brokerage website right now and within 24 hours have a US-dollar-denominated account that can trade on the Tokyo stock exchange. That is privilege. That is a facility afforded to less than a billion people in the world. One out of seven. The other 6 billion? They barely have basic checking, if that. A lot of them live in cash-or barter-based societies. So, the question you then have to ask is what happens when a farmer in Kenya who has a Nokia 1000 text-messaging phone, and suddenly that phone is a Bloomberg terminal, a loan-origination terminal, a Western Union remittance-termination terminal, a stock market, is a bank—not a terminal to a bank, but a bank, on the phone? And what happens when that is afforded to the other 6 billion all over the world. \n \n\\### 8.5. Interstitial Innovation\n\\\u003e Here’s a little thought experiment: Let’s take three radically disruptive technologies and mash them together. Bitcoin. Uber. Self-driving cars. What happens when you mash the three together? The self-owning car. A car that pays for its Toyota lease, its insurance, and its gas, by giving people rides. A car that is not owned by a corporation. A car that is a corporation. A car that is a shareholder and owner of its own corporation. A car that exists as an autonomous financial entity with no human ownership. This has never happened before, and that’s just the beginning. \n \n\\## 9. Money as a Content Type\n\\\u003e One of the magic things about bitcoin is that the transaction doesn’t incorporate security mechanisms itself. The security is in the proof of work provided by the miners, and the digital signature on the transaction is put there by end users with keys that they store. There’s nothing sensitive or secret in the bitcoin transaction. \n \n\\### 9.2. Bitcoin Transactions: Secure by Design\n\\\u003e Bitcoin is fundamentally different. What I’m transmitting is not the key, but simply a signed message. It is an authorization. That authorization has two external references: (1) to where the money’s coming from by referencing an unspent output on the blockchain, and (2) a reference to where I want to send the money —by creating a new encumbrance, a new limitation on who can spend the money, usually a public key or bitcoin address. That transaction contains no sensitive data. If you steal the information in the transaction, all you know is which address the money came from, which address the money’s going to, and how much. That’s it. The signature reveals nothing. The addresses reveal nothing. There are no identifiers. You could take the transaction and print it out. You could post it on a billboard. You could shout it from the rooftop. A bitcoin transaction can be transmitted over completely unsecured Wi-Fi. By smoke signal. By light signal. With carrier pigeons. It doesn’t matter. Nothing in that message can be compromised. \n \n\\### 9.3. Money as a Content Type\n\\\u003e Most people don’t realize what it means to convert money into a content type. We’ve taken the transaction, which is just 250 bytes, and we’ve separated it from the transport medium, so it doesn’t depend on any underlying security. We’ve made it stand alone so that it can be independently verified by any node that has a full copy of the blockchain. Independently verified as spendable, authentic, and properly signed by any system that has a full copy of the blockchain—in fact, even by systems that only have a partial copy of the blockchain. That transaction can be verified in seconds. All it has to do is reach one node in the network that can talk to miners. That’s it. Once it’s injected into the bitcoin network and once it propagates, you can be almost certain that the transaction will be included eventually and will become valid. If I look at any transaction, I can calculate if it has sufficient fees, and then I can make certain assumptions about how miners are going to treat that transaction because I know the rules by which they operate on a consensus network. I know that once the transaction is propagated enough, it will appear in a block near you, soon. \n \n\\### 9.5. Separating the Medium and the Message\n\\\u003e Because they mocked it. They made the mistaken assumption that if the cost of production is zero, the value of the message is zero. They confused the medium for the message. They made the mistaken assumption that their control over the medium was the source of quality. And long after quality disappeared, they clung to control and thought that control was the only way to achieve quality, and if you removed control, you removed quality. That is stinky, unabashed elitism at its absolute worst. It assumes that the gatekeepers are the source of quality, when all they are is gatekeepers. They assume that the fact that they have the expensive medium means that the message is worth listening to.\n","method":["Digital"],"rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recudmTU6wPvwPLBt"},{"title":"Moana","media":"Movie","date":"2017-12-03","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/moana-2016/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recDH8Uhts2H7Hk2I"},{"title":"Logan Lucky","media":"Movie","date":"2017-11-28","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/logan-lucky/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"reckiO2lXNfpgr1ND"},{"title":"Kong: Skull Island","media":"Movie","date":"2017-11-27","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/kong-skull-island/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recgKlG5CdZcLQFdY"},{"title":"Lady Bird","media":"Movie","date":"2017-11-26","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/lady-bird/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recpLSteoKBaewYRA"},{"title":"The Godfather","media":"Movie","date":"2017-11-22","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-godfather/","rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recUNDXZcTZQYUdnE"},{"title":"The Godfather: Part II","media":"Movie","date":"2017-11-22","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-godfather-part-ii/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"rec9RKCqMVvVJLcAg"},{"title":"Spider-Man: Homecoming","media":"Movie","date":"2017-11-21","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/spider-man-homecoming/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recUhE6HE4AFg0ZbP"},{"title":"Wind River","media":"Movie","date":"2017-11-14","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/wind-river-2017/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recsSRhUpGB31jEGe"},{"title":"Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy","media":"Book","creator":"Miyamoto Musashi","length":96,"year":"1645","date":"2017-11-13","date_updated":"2017-06-05","status":"Complete","summary":"\\\u003e The principle of strategy is having one thing, to know ten thousand things.\n\\\u003e \n\n\\\u003e It will seem difficult at first, but everything is difficult at first.\n\\\u003e \n\n\\\u003e You should not have a favorite weapon.

There are many obvious advantages to this. You don’t have to dress up, for instance, and you can’t hear them boo you right away.\n \n\\\u003e I became a socialist, for five weeks. Then the bus ride to my socialist meetings wore me out.\n \n\\\u003e “Do it every day for a while,” my father kept saying. “Do it as you would do scales on the piano. Do it by prearrangement with yourself. Do it as a debt of honor. And make a commitment to finishing things.”\n \n\\\u003e Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don’t give up.\n \n\\\u003e They will have days at the desk of frantic boredom, of angry hopelessness, of wanting to quit forever, and there will be days when it feels like they have caught and are riding a wave.\n \n\\### Writing Groups\n\\\u003e You don’t always have to chop with the sword of truth. You can point with it, too.\n\n\\## Part One: WRITING \n\\### Getting Started\n\\\u003e The very first thing I tell my new students on the first day of a workshop is that good writing is about telling the truth. We are a species that needs and wants to understand who we are.\n\n\\\u003e But after a few days at the desk, telling the truth in an interesting way turns out to be about as easy and pleasurable as bathing a cat.\n \n\\\u003e Flannery O’Connor said that anyone who survived childhood has enough material to write for the rest of his or her life.\n \n\\\u003e Remember that you own what happened to you.\n \n\\\u003e Just put down on paper everything you can remember now about your parents and siblings and relatives and neighbors, and we will deal with libel later on.\n \n\\\u003e Becoming a better writer is going to help you become a better reader, and that is the real payoff.\n \n\\\u003e Writing can give you what having a baby can give you: it can get you to start paying attention, can help you soften, can wake you up.\n \n\\\u003e My son, Sam, at three and a half, had these keys to a set of plastic handcuffs, and one morning he intentionally locked himself out of the house. I was sitting on the couch reading the newspaper when I heard him stick his plastic keys into the doorknob and try to open the door. Then I heard him say, “Oh, shit.” My whole face widened, like the guy in Edvard Munch’s Scream. After a moment I got up and opened the front door. “Honey,” I said, “what’d you just say?” “I said, ‘Oh, shit,’ ” he said. “But, honey, that’s a naughty word. Both of us have absolutely got to stop using it. Okay?” He hung his head for a moment, nodded, and said, “Okay, Mom.” Then he leaned forward and said confidentially, “But I’ll tell you why I said ‘shit.’ ” I said Okay, and he said, “Because of the fucking keys!”\n \n\\### Short Assignments\n\\\u003e Writing can be a pretty desperate endeavor, because it is about some of our deepest needs: our need to be visible, to be heard, our need to make sense of our lives, to wake up and grow and belong.\n \n\\\u003e We are just going to take this bird by bird. But we are going to finish this one short assignment.\n \n\\### Shitty First Drafts\n\\\u003e The first draft is the child’s draft, where you let it all pour out and then let it romp all over the place, knowing that no one is going to see it and that you can shape it later. You just let this childlike part of you channel whatever voices and visions come through and onto the page.\n \n\\\u003e A friend of mine says that the first draft is the down draft—you just get it down. The second draft is the up draft—you fix it up. You try to say what you have to say more accurately. And the third draft is the dental draft, where you check every tooth, to see if it’s loose or cramped or decayed, or even, God help us, healthy.\n \n\\\u003e Left to its own devices, my mind spends much of its time having conversations with people who aren’t there.\n \n\\\u003e Close your eyes and get quiet for a minute, until the chatter starts up. Then isolate one of the voices and imagine the person speaking as a mouse. Pick it up by the tail and drop it into a mason jar. Then isolate another voice, pick it up by the tail, drop it in the jar. And so on.\n \n\\### Perfectionism\n\\\u003e Perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor, the enemy of the people. It will keep you cramped and insane your whole life, and it is the main obstacle between you and a shitty first draft.\n \n\\### Character\n\\\u003e How would your main characters describe their current circumstances to a close friend, before and then after a few drinks?\n \n\\\u003e I once asked Ethan Canin to tell me the most valuable thing he knew about writing, and without hesitation he said, “Nothing is as important as a likable narrator. Nothing holds a story together better.”\n \n\\\u003e Novels ought to have hope; at least, American novels ought to have hope. French novels don’t need to. We mostly win wars, they lose them.\n \n\\### Plot\n\\\u003e Plot grows out of character. If you focus on who the people in your story are, if you sit and write about two people you know and are getting to know better day by day, something is bound to happen. Characters should not, conversely, serve as pawns for some plot you’ve dreamed up.\n \n\\\u003e Find out what each character cares most about in the world because then you will have discovered what’s at stake.\n \n\\\u003e John Gardner wrote that the writer is creating a dream into which he or she invites the reader, and that the dream must be vivid and continuous. I tell my students to write this down—that the dream must be vivid and continuous—because it is so crucial.\n \n\\\u003e The basic formula for drama is setup, buildup, payoff—just like a joke.\n \n\\\u003e She said that sometimes she uses a formula when writing a short story, which goes ABDCE, for Action, Background, Development, Climax, and Ending. You begin with action that is compelling enough to draw us in, make us want to know more. Background is where you let us see and know who these people are, how they’ve come to be together, what was going on before the opening of the story. Then you develop these people, so that we learn what they care most about. The plot—the drama, the actions, the tension—will grow out of that. You move them along until everything comes together in the climax, after which things are different for the main characters, different in some real way. And then there is the ending: what is our sense of who these people are now, what are they left with, what happened, and what did it mean?\n \n\\### Dialogue\n\\\u003e Then when you’re out in the world—that is, not at your desk—and you hear people talking, you’ll find yourself editing their dialogue, playing with it, seeing in your mind’s eye what it would look like on the page. You listen to how people really talk, and then learn little by little to take someone’s five-minute speech and make it one sentence, without losing anything. If you are a writer, or want to be a writer, this is how you spend your days—listening, observing, storing things away, making your isolation pay off.\n \n\\\u003e I don’t think the right words exist already in your head, any more than the characters do. They exist somewhere else. What we have in our heads are fragments and thoughts and things we’ve heard and memorized, and we take our little ragbag and reach into it and throw some stuff down and then our unconscious kicks in.\n \n\\\u003e You must learn about people from people, not from what you read. Your reading should confirm what you’ve observed in the world.\n \n\\\u003e The villain has a heart, and the hero has great flaws.\n \n\\\u003e Try to remember that to some extent, you’re just the typist. A good typist listens.\n \n\\### Set Design\n\\\u003e People used to give me potted plants and trees, and what happened to them is really too horrible to go into here. They’d end up looking like I watered them with Agent Orange.\n \n\\\u003e Metaphors are a great language tool, because they explain the unknown in terms of the known. But they only work if they resonate in the heart of the writer.\n \n\\### False Starts\n\\\u003e You can see the underlying essence only when you strip away the busyness, and then some surprising connections appear.\n \n\\### How Do You Know: When You’re Done?\n\\\u003e ...perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor.\n \n\\## Part Two: THE WRITING FRAME OF MIND\n\\### The Moral Point of View\n\\\u003e If your deepest beliefs drive your writing, they will not only keep your work from being contrived but will help you discover what drives your characters.\n \n\\\u003e If you don’t believe in what you are saying, there is no point in your saying it. You might as well call it a day and go bowling.\n \n\\### Broccoli\n\\\u003e Writing is about hypnotizing yourself into believing in yourself, getting some work done, then unhypnotizing yourself and going over the material coldly.\n \n\\### Radio Station KFKD\n\\\u003e So now I always tell my students about the Gulf Stream: that what it means for us, for writers, is that we need to align ourselves with the river of the story, the river of the unconscious, of memory and sensibility, of our characters’ lives, which can then pour through us, the straw.\n \n\\### Jealousy\n\\\u003e My therapist said that jealousy is a secondary emotion, that it is born out of feeling excluded and deprived.\n \n\\## Part Three: HELP ALONG THE WAY \n\\### Index Cards\n\\\u003e I think that if you have the kind of mind that retains important and creative thoughts—that is, if your mind still works—you’re very lucky and you should not be surprised if the rest of us do not want to be around you.\n \n\\### Someone to Read Your Drafts\n\\\u003e Beginners always try to fit their whole lives into ten pages, and they always write blatantly about themselves,\n \n\\### Writer’s Block\n\\\u003e We’re mimics, we’re parrots—we’re writers. But knowing the source of all our stuff deprives it of its magic, because then the material feels mundane, clichéd; you didn’t have to discover it because it was already there for all to see.\n \n\\\u003e Life is like a recycling center, where all the concerns and dramas of humankind get recycled back and forth across the universe. But what you have to offer is your own sensibility, maybe your own sense of humor or insider pathos or meaning. All of us can sing the same song, and there will still be four billion different renditions. Some people will sing it spontaneously, with a lot of soulful riffs, while others are going to practice until they could sing it at the Met. Either way, everything we need in order to tell our stories in a reasonable and exciting way already exists in each of us. Everything you need is in your head and memories, in all that your senses provide, in all that you’ve seen and thought and absorbed.\n \n\\## Part Four: PUBLICATION—AND OTHER REASONS TO WRITE \n\\### Writing a Present\n\\\u003e Violet Weingarten’s Intimations of Mortality, a journal of her chemotherapy...\n \n\\### Finding Your Voice\n\\\u003e Write as if your parents are dead.\n \n\\\u003e We don’t have much truth to express unless we have gone into those rooms and closets and woods and abysses that we were told not to go in to. When we have gone in and looked around for a long while, just breathing and finally taking it in—then we will be able to speak in our own voice and to stay in the present moment.\n \n\\## Part Five: THE LAST CLASS \n\\\u003e This is what separates artists from ordinary people: the belief, deep in our hearts, that if we build our castles well enough, somehow the ocean won’t wash them away. I think this is a wonderful kind of person to be.\n \n\\\u003e You don’t even have to know how or in what way, but if you are writing the clearest, truest words you can find and doing the best you can to understand and communicate, this will shine on paper like its own little lighthouse. Lighthouses don’t go running all over an island looking for boats to save; they just stand there shining. \n \n\\## Vocabulary\n\\- Estimable - worthy of great respect\n\\- Derisively - in a manner expressing contempt or ridicule\n\\- Stultify - to make, or cause to appear, foolish or ridiculous\n\\- Desiccated - lacking interest, passion, or energy\n\\- Effusive - unduly demonstrative\n\\- Rolfed - to vomit\n\\- Rend - to tear apart, split, or divide\n\\- Piffle - nonsense\n\\- Scull - a boat propelled by an oar\n\\- Beatifically - bestowing bliss\n","method":["Digital"],"rating":"★★★★★","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recfoP6ktSmPRiK2d"},{"title":"Discipline Equals Freedom: Field Manual","media":"Book","creator":"Jocko Willink","length":189,"year":"2017","date":"2017-10-21","date_updated":"2017-10-21","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","method":["Physical"],"rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recPuODrxaBjjWnZM"},{"title":"The Cabin in the Woods","media":"Movie","date":"2017-10-14","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-cabin-in-the-woods/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recSsIIpPqmUwuGem"},{"title":"Cocaine Cowboys 2","media":"Movie","date":"2017-10-13","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/cocaine-cowboys-ii-hustlin-with-the-godmother/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recPLpxoMJez871Uv"},{"title":"Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging","media":"Book","creator":"Sebastian Junger","length":182,"year":"2016","date":"2017-10-12","date_updated":"2017-10-05","status":"Complete","summary":"\\## THE MEN AND THE DOGS \n\\\u003e It was a simple ethos that promoted loyalty and courage over all other virtues and considered the preservation of the tribe an almost sacred task.\n \n\\\u003e But as societies become more affluent they tend to require more, rather than less, time and commitment by the individual, and it’s possible that many people feel that affluence and safety simply aren’t a good trade for freedom.\n \n\\\u003e First agriculture, and then industry, changed two fundamental things about the human experience. The accumulation of personal property allowed people to make more and more individualistic choices about their lives, and those choices unavoidably diminished group efforts toward a common good. And as society modernized, people found themselves able to live independently from any communal group. A person living in a modern city or a suburb can, for the first time in history, go through an entire day—or an entire life—mostly encountering complete strangers. They can be surrounded by others and yet feel deeply, dangerously alone.\n \n\\\u003e As affluence and urbanization rise in a society, rates of depression and suicide tend to go up rather than down. Rather than buffering people from clinical depression, increased wealth in a society seems to foster it.\n \n\\\u003e The mechanism seems simple: poor people are forced to share their time and resources more than wealthy people are, and as a result they live in closer communities.\n \n\\\u003e ...self-determination theory, which holds that human beings need three basic things in order to be content: they need to feel competent at what they do; they need to feel authentic in their lives; and they need to feel connected to others. These values are considered “intrinsic” to human happiness and far outweigh “extrinsic” values such as beauty, money, and status.\n \n\\\u003e All told, combined public-and private-sector fraud costs every household in the United States probably around $5,000 a year—or roughly the equivalent of working four months at a minimum-wage job. A hunter-gatherer community that lost four months’ worth of food would face a serious threat to its survival, and its retribution against the people who caused that hardship would be immediate and probably very violent.\n \n\\\u003e The fact that a group of people can cost American society several trillion dollars in losses—roughly one-quarter of that year’s gross domestic product—and not be tried for high crimes shows how completely de-tribalized the country has become.\n \n\\## WAR MAKES YOU AN ANIMAL \n\\\u003e “When people are actively engaged in a cause their lives have more purpose… with a resulting improvement in mental health,” Lyons wrote in the Journal of Psychosomatic Research in 1979. “It would be irresponsible to suggest violence as a means of improving mental health, but the Belfast findings suggest that people will feel better psychologically if they have more involvement with their community.”\n \n\\\u003e Fritz’s theory was that modern society has gravely disrupted the social bonds that have always characterized the human experience, and that disasters thrust people back into a more ancient, organic way of relating. Disasters, he proposed, create a “community of sufferers” that allows individuals to experience an immensely reassuring connection to others. As people come together to face an existential threat, Fritz found, class differences are temporarily erased, income disparities become irrelevant, race is overlooked, and individuals are assessed simply by what they are willing to do for the group. It is a kind of fleeting social utopia that, Fritz felt, is enormously gratifying to the average person and downright therapeutic to people suffering from mental illness.\n \n\\\u003e What catastrophes seem to do—sometimes in the span of a few minutes—is turn back the clock on ten thousand years of social evolution. Self-interest gets subsumed into group interest because there is no survival outside group survival, and that creates a social bond that many people sorely miss.\n \n\\## IN BITTER SAFETY I AWAKE \n\\\u003e Suicide is often seen as an extreme expression of PTSD, but researchers have not yet found any relationship between suicide and combat. Combat veterans are, statistically, no more likely to kill themselves than veterans who were never under fire. The much-discussed estimate of twenty-two vets a day committing suicide in the United States is deceptive: it was only in 2008 that—for the first time in decades—the suicide rate among veterans surpassed the civilian rate in America, and though each death is enormously tragic, the majority of those veterans were over the age of fifty. Many were Vietnam vets and, generally speaking, the more time that passes after a trauma, the less likely a suicide is to have anything to do with it. Among younger vets, deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan actually lowers the risk of suicide, because soldiers with obvious mental health issues are not deployed with their units.\n \n\\\u003e One study found that one in four Peace Corps volunteers reported experiencing significant depression after their return home, and that figure more than doubled for people who had been evacuated from their host country during wartime or some other kind of emergency.\n \n\\\u003e “There were fifteen men to a gun. You had fifteen guys who for the first time in their lives were not living in a competitive society. We had no hopes of becoming officers. I liked that feeling very much… It was the absence of competition and boundaries and all those phony standards that created the thing I loved about the Army.”\n \n\\\u003e Such public meaning is probably not generated by the kinds of formulaic phrases, such as “Thank you for your service,” that many Americans now feel compelled to offer soldiers and vets. Neither is it generated by honoring vets at sporting events, allowing them to board planes first, or giving them minor discounts at stores. If anything, these token acts only deepen the chasm between the military and civilian populations by highlighting the fact that some people serve their country but the vast majority don’t.\n \n\\\u003e Because modern society has almost completely eliminated trauma and violence from everyday life, anyone who does suffer those things is deemed to be extraordinarily unfortunate. This gives people access to sympathy and resources but also creates an identity of victimhood that can delay recovery.\n \n\\\u003e Mende combatants often described combat as something that makes the heart “heat up,” transforming a fighter to the point where he is thought to have literally become someone else. In that state he is capable of both great courage and great cruelty. Such a state of hyperarousal is familiar to many soldiers or athletes and has a firm basis in the neurobiology of the brain.\n \n\\## CALLING HOME FROM MARS \n\\\u003e The public is often accused of being disconnected from its military, but frankly it’s disconnected from just about everything. Farming, mineral extraction, gas and oil production, bulk cargo transport, logging, fishing, infrastructure construction—all the industries that keep the nation going are mostly unacknowledged by the people who depend on them most.\n \n\\\u003e My friend Ellis was once asked by a troubled young boy whether there was any compelling reason for him not to pull the legs off a spider. Ellis said that there was. “Well, spiders don’t feel any pain,” the boy retorted. “It’s not the spider I’m worried about,” Ellis said.\n \n\\\u003e One way to determine what is missing in day-to-day American life may be to examine what behaviors spontaneously arise when that life is disrupted.\n \n\\\u003e Today’s veterans often come home to find that, although they’re willing to die for their country, they’re not sure how to live for it. It’s hard to know how to live for a country that regularly tears itself apart along every possible ethnic and demographic boundary.\n \n\\\u003e Unlike criticism, contempt is particularly toxic because it assumes a moral superiority in the speaker. Contempt is often directed at people who have been excluded from a group or declared unworthy of its benefits. Contempt is often used by governments to provide rhetorical cover for torture or abuse. Contempt is one of four behaviors that, statistically, can predict divorce in married couples. People who speak with contempt for one another will probably not remain united for long.\n \n\\## POSTSCRIPT \n\\\u003e There, finally, was my answer for why the homeless guy outside Gillette gave me his lunch thirty years ago: just dead inside. It was the one thing that, poor as he was, he absolutely refused to be. \n","method":["Digital"],"rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recQSfBg8ydlqWO1e"},{"title":"Cocaine Cowboys","media":"Movie","date":"2017-10-12","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/cocaine-cowboys/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"rec8NsyAPa8VL3gJ2"},{"title":"Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less","media":"Book","creator":"Greg McKeown","length":272,"year":"2011","date":"2017-10-04","date_updated":"2017-07-11","status":"Complete","summary":"\\### 1. The Essentialist\n\n\\\u003e Essentialism: only once you give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter. \n \n\\\u003e The way of the Essentialist is the relentless pursuit of less but better. \n \n\\\u003e Essentialism is a disciplined, systematic approach for determining where our highest point of contribution lies, then making execution of those things almost effortless. \n \n\\\u003e If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will. \n \n\\\u003e It leads to what I call “the paradox of success,” which can be summed up in four predictable phases: \n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e PHASE 1: When we really have clarity of purpose, it enables us to succeed at our endeavor. \n\\\u003e PHASE 2: When we have success, we gain a reputation as a “go to” person. We become “good old [insert name],” who is always there when you need him, and we are presented with increased options and opportunities. \n\\\u003e PHASE 3: When we have increased options and opportunities, which is actually code for demands upon our time and energies, it leads to diffused efforts. We get spread thinner and thinner.\n\\\u003e PHASE 4: We become distracted from what would otherwise be our highest level of contribution. The effect of our success has been to undermine the very clarity that led to our success in the first place. \n \n\\\u003e How the Mighty Fall, Jim Collins \n \n\\\u003e The word priority came into the English language in the 1400s. It was singular. It meant the very first or prior thing. It stayed singular for the next five hundred years. Only in the 1900s did we pluralize the term and start talking about priorities. Illogically, we reasoned that by changing the word we could bend reality. Somehow we would now be able to have multiple “first” things. \n \n\\\u003e “If I didn’t already own this, how much would I spend to buy it?” \n \n\\\u003e Essentialists spend as much time as possible exploring, listening, debating, questioning, and thinking. But their exploration is not an end in itself. The purpose of the exploration is to discern the vital few from the trivial many. \n \n\\\u003e What if we stopped celebrating being busy as a measurement of importance? What if instead we celebrated how much time we had spent listening, pondering, meditating, and enjoying time with the most important people in our lives?\n \n\\## Part I: Essence: What is the core mind-set of an Essentialist? \n\n\\\u003e To embrace the essence of Essentialism requires we replace these false assumptions with three core truths: “I choose to,” “Only a few things really matter,” and “I can do anything but not everything.” These simple truths awaken us from our nonessential stupor. They free us to pursue what really matters. They enable us to live at our highest level of contribution. \n \n\\### 2. Choose: The Invincible Power of Choice\n\\\u003e The ability to choose cannot be taken away or even given away—it can only be forgotten. \n \n\\### 3. Discern: The Unimportance of Practically Everything\n\n\\\u003e Most of what exists in the universe—our actions, and all other forces, resources, and ideas—has little value and yields little result; on the other hand, a few things work fantastically well and have tremendous impact. —Richard Koch\n \n\\\u003e The Tao of Warren Buffett, Mary Buffett and David Clark explain: “Warren decided early in his career it would be impossible for him to make hundreds of right investment decisions, so he decided that he would invest only in the businesses that he was absolutely sure of, and then bet heavily on them. He owes 90% of his wealth to just ten investments. Sometimes what you don’t do is just as important as what you do.” In short, he makes big bets on the essential few investment opportunities and says no to the many merely good ones.\n \n\\\u003e The overwhelming reality is: we live in a world where almost everything is worthless and a very few things are exceptionally valuable. As John Maxwell has written, “You cannot overestimate the unimportance of practically everything.”\n \n\\### 4. Trade-Off: Which Problem Do I Want? \n\n\\\u003e The reality is, saying yes to any opportunity by definition requires saying no to several others.\n \n\\\u003e As economist Thomas Sowell wrote: “There are no solutions. There are only trade-offs.”\n \n\\\u003e Jim Collins, the author of the business classic Good to Great, was once told by Peter Drucker that he could either build a great company or build great ideas but not both. Jim chose ideas. As a result of this trade-off there are still only three full-time employees in his company, yet his ideas have reached tens of millions of people through his writing.\n \n\\\u003e Essentialists see trade-offs as an inherent part of life, not as an inherently negative part of life. Instead of asking, “What do I have to give up?” they ask, “What do I want to go big on?” The cumulative impact of this small change in thinking can be profound.\n \n\\\u003e In a piece called “Laugh, Kookaburra” published in The New Yorker, David Sedaris gives a humorous account of his experience touring the Australian “bush.” While hiking, his friend and guide for the day shares something she has heard in passing at a management class. “Imagine a four-burner stove,” she instructs the members of the party. “One burner represents your family, one is your friends, the third is your health, and the fourth is your work. In order to be successful you have to cut off one of your burners. And in order to be really successful you have to cut off two.”\n \n\\## Part II: Explore: How can we discern the trivial many from the vital few? \n\n\\\u003e Because Essentialists will commit and “go big” on only the vital few ideas or activities, they explore more options at first to ensure they pick the right one later. \n \n\\\u003e To discern what is truly essential we need space to think, time to look and listen, permission to play, wisdom to sleep, and the discipline to apply highly selective criteria to the choices we make. \n \n\\\u003e Essentialists spend as much time as possible exploring, listening, debating, questioning, and thinking. But their exploration is not an end in itself. The purpose of the exploration is to discern the vital few from the trivial many. \n \n\\### 5. Escape: The Perks of Being Unavailable\n\n\\\u003e For some reason there is a false association with the word focus. As with choice, people tend to think of focus as a thing. Yes, focus is something we have. But focus is also something we do. \n \n\\### 6. Look: See What Really Matters\n\n\\\u003e Charlie O. Simms taught a Journalism 101 class in Beverly Hills High School. He started the first day of the class Ephron attended much the same way any journalism teacher would, by explaining the concept of a “lead.” He explained that a lead contains the why, what, when, and who of the piece. It covers the essential information. Then he gave them their first assignment: write a lead to a story. Simms began by presenting the facts of the story: “Kenneth L. Peters, the principal of Beverly Hills High School, announced today that the entire high school faculty will travel to Sacramento next Thursday for a colloquium in new teaching methods. Among the speakers will be anthropologist Margaret Mead, college president Dr. Robert Maynard Hutchins, and California governor Edmund ‘Pat’ Brown.” The students hammered away on their manual typewriters trying to keep up with the teacher’s pace. Then they handed in their rapidly written leads. Each attempted to summarize the who, what, where, and why as succinctly as possible: “Margaret Mead, Maynard Hutchins, and Governor Brown will address the faculty on …”; “Next Thursday, the high school faculty will …” Simms reviewed the students’ leads and put them aside. He then informed them that they were all wrong. The lead to the story, he said, was “There will be no school Thursday.” “In that instant,” Ephron recalls, “I realized that journalism was not just about regurgitating the facts but about figuring out the point. It wasn’t enough to know the who, what, when, and where; you had to understand what it meant. And why it mattered.” Ephron added, “He taught me something that works just as well in life as it does in journalism.”\n \n\\### 7. Play: Embrace the Wisdom of Your Inner Child\n\n\\\u003e Yet of all animal species, Stuart Brown writes, humans are the biggest players of all. We are built to play and built through play. When we play, we are engaged in the purest expression of our humanity, the truest expression of our individuality. Is it any wonder that often the times we feel most alive, those that make up our best memories, are moments of play? \n \n\\### 8. Sleep: Protect the Asset\n\n\\\u003e If we underinvest in ourselves, and by that I mean our minds, our bodies, and our spirits, we damage the very tool we need to make our highest contribution.\n \n\\\u003e I also remember Bill Clinton was quoted as saying that every major mistake he had made in his life had happened as a result of sleep deprivation. \n \n\\### 9. Select: The Power of Extreme Criteria\n\n\\\u003e In a piece called “No More Yes. It’s Either HELL YEAH! Or No,” the popular TED speaker Derek Sivers describes a simple technique for becoming more selective in the choices we make.\n \n\\\u003e You can think of this as the 90 Percent Rule, and it’s one you can apply to just about every decision or dilemma. As you evaluate an option, think about the single most important criterion for that decision, and then simply give the option a score between 0 and 100. If you rate it any lower than 90 percent, then automatically change the rating to 0 and simply reject it. This way you avoid getting caught up in indecision, or worse, getting stuck with the 60s or 70s. Think about how you’d feel if you scored a 65 on some test. Why would you deliberately choose to feel that way about an important choice in your life? \n \n\\## Part III: Eliminate: How can we cut out the trivial many? \n\n\\### 11. Dare: The Power of a Graceful “No”\n\n\\\u003e A case in point is the time the graphic designer Paul Rand had the guts to say no to Steve Jobs. When Jobs was looking for a logo for the company NeXT, he asked Rand, whose work included the logos for IBM, UPS, Enron, Westinghouse, and ABC, to come up with a few options. But Rand didn’t want to come up with “a few options.” He wanted to design just one option. So Rand said: “No. I will solve your problem for you. And you will pay me. And you don’t have to use the solution. If you want options go talk to other people. But I will solve the problem the best way I know how. And you use it or not. That’s up to you.” Not surprisingly, Rand solved the problem and created the “jewel” logo Jobs wanted, but the real lesson here is the effect Rand’s “push back” had on Jobs, who later said of Rand, “He is one of the most professional people I have ever worked with: in the sense that he had thought through all of the formal relationship between a client and a professional such as himself.” Rand took a risk when he said no. He bet a short-term popularity loss for a long-term gain in respect. And it paid off.\n \n\\\u003e One leader I know found her time being hijacked by other people all day. A classic Nonessentialist, she was capable and smart and unable to say no, and as a result she soon became a “go to” person. People would run up to her and say, “Could you help with X project?” Meaning to be a good citizen, she said yes. But soon she felt burdened with all of these different agendas. Things changed for her when she learned to use a new phrase: “Let me check my calendar and get back to you.” It gave her the time to pause and reflect and ultimately reply that she was regretfully unavailable. It enabled her to take back control of her own decisions rather than be rushed into a “yes” when she was asked.\n \n\\\u003e Say, “Yes. What should I deprioritize?” Saying no to a senior leader at work is almost unthinkable, even laughable, for many people. However, when saying yes is going to compromise your ability to make the highest level of contribution to your work, it is also your obligation. In this case it is not only reasonable to say no, it is essential. One effective way to do that is to remind your superiors what you would be neglecting if you said yes and force them to grapple with the trade-off. For example, if your manager comes to you and asks you to do X, you can respond with “Yes, I’m happy to make this the priority. Which of these other projects should I deprioritize to pay attention to this new project?” Or simply say, “I would want to do a great job, and given my other commitments I wouldn’t be able to do a job I was proud of if I took this on.” I know a leader who received this response from a subordinate. There was no way he wanted to be responsible for disrupting this productive and organized employee, so he took the nonessential work project back and gave it to someone else who was less organized! \n \n\\### 12. Uncommit: Win Big by Cutting Your Losses\n\n\\\u003e Sunk-cost bias is the tendency to continue to invest time, money, or energy into something we know is a losing proposition simply because we have already incurred, or sunk, a cost that cannot be recouped.\n \n\\\u003e Tom Stafford describes a simple antidote to the endowment effect. Instead of asking, “How much do I value this item?” we should ask, “If I did not own this item, how much would I pay to obtain it?” We can do the same for opportunities and commitment. Don’t ask, “How will I feel if I miss out on this opportunity?” but rather, “If I did not have this opportunity, how much would I be willing to sacrifice in order to obtain it?”\n \n\\\u003e You can apply zero-based budgeting to your own endeavors. Instead of trying to budget your time on the basis of existing commitments, assume that all bets are off. All previous commitments are gone. Then begin from scratch, asking which you would add today. You can do this with everything from the financial obligations you have to projects you are committed to, even relationships you are in. \n \n\\### 13. Edit: The Invisible Art\n\n\\\u003e The best surgeon is not the one who makes the most incisions; similarly, the best editors can sometimes be the least intrusive, the most restrained.\n \n\\\u003e Becoming an Essentialist means making cutting, condensing, and correcting a natural part of our daily routine—making editing a natural cadence in our lives. \n \n\\### 14. Limit: The Freedom of Setting Boundaries\n\n\\\u003e Boundaries are a little like the walls of a sandcastle. The second we let one fall over, the rest of them come crashing down.\n \n\\\u003e After all, if you don’t set boundaries—there won’t be any. Or even worse, there will be boundaries, but they’ll be set by default—or by another person—instead of by design.\n \n\\\u003e Whoever it is that’s trying to siphon off your time and energies for their own purpose, the only solution is to put up fences. And not at the moment the request is made—you need to put up your fences well in advance, clearly demarcating what’s off limits so you can head off time wasters and boundary pushers at the pass. Remember, forcing these people to solve their own problems is equally beneficial for you and for them. \n \n\\## Part IV: Execute: How can we make doing the vital few things almost effortless? \n\n\\\u003e While Nonessentialists tend to force execution, Essentialists invest the time they have saved by eliminating the nonessentials into designing a system to make execution almost effortless. \n \n\\### 15. Buffer: The Unfair Advantage \n\n\\\u003e The way of the Essentialist, on the other hand, is to use the good times to create a buffer for the bad. \n \n\\### 16. Subtract: Bring Forth More by Removing Obstacles\n\n\\\u003e To reduce the friction with another person, apply the “catch more flies with honey” approach. Send him an e-mail, but instead of asking if he has done the work for you (which obviously he hasn’t), go and see him. Ask him, “What obstacles or bottlenecks are holding you back from achieving X, and how can I help remove these?” Instead of pestering him, offer sincerely to support him. \n \n\\### 17. Progress: The Power of Small Wins\n\n\\\u003e Instead of going for the big, flashy wins that don’t really matter, the Essentialist pursues small and simple wins in areas that are essential.\n \n\\\u003e Similarly, we can adopt a method of “minimal viable progress.” We can ask ourselves, “What is the smallest amount of progress that will be useful and valuable to the essential task we are trying to get done?” \n \n\\### 18. Flow: The Genius of Routine\n\n\\\u003e Designs a routine that enshrines what is essential, making execution almost effortless.\n \n\\\u003e The work Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has done on creativity demonstrates how highly creative people use strict routines to free up their minds. “Most creative individuals find out early what their best rhythms are for sleeping, eating, and working, and abide by them even when it is tempting to do otherwise,” Mihaly says. “They wear clothes that are comfortable, they interact only with people they find congenial, they do only things they think are important. Of course, such idiosyncrasies are not endearing to those they have to deal with.… But personalizing patterns of action helps to free the mind from the expectations that make demands on attention and allows intense concentration on matters that count.”\n \n\\\u003e In an interview about his book The Power of Habit Charles Duhigg said “in the last 15 years, as we’ve learned how habits work and how they can be changed, scientists have explained that every habit is made up of a cue, a routine, and a reward. The cue is a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine—the behavior itself—which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular habit is worth remembering for the future. \n \n\\### 19. Focus: What’s Important Now?\n\n\\\u003e When I talk about being present, I’m not talking about doing only one thing at a time. I’m talking about being focused on one thing at a time. \n","method":["Digital"],"rating":"★★★★★","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recDP7b20zOfRyJQV"},{"title":"Circle","media":"Movie","date":"2017-10-02","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/circle-2015/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recj0YVKm9ykb1YDb"},{"title":"The Big Sick","media":"Movie","date":"2017-09-30","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-big-sick/","rating":"☆☆☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recYx6KPcHMQSRwTQ"},{"title":"The Hardstyle Kettlebell Challenge: A Fundamental Guide To Training For Strength And Power","media":"Book","creator":"Dan John","year":"2017","date":"2017-09-24","date_updated":"2017-09-23","status":"Complete","summary":"\\## What is the HKC? \n\\\u003e Instead it is the ability to hold together “in one piece”, as I say in one of my three key principles of training: The body is one piece. There are three kinds of strength training: putting weights overhead, picking them up off the ground, and/ or carrying them for time or distance. All training is complementary.\n \n\\\u003e Anaconda strength is the body squeezing and the inner tube of the body pushing back to keep integrity.\n \n\\\u003e Armor building is the development of callouses or body armor to withstand the contact and collisions with other people and the environment. \n \n\\## Why the HKC? \n\\\u003e I have spent my life trying to understand weightlifting. It seems to me that there are three important keys: Fundamental Human Movements Reps and Sets Load I also think this is the correct order to approach weightlifting. First, we need to establish the correct postures and patterns, then work around a reasonable number of movements in a training session.\n \n\\\u003e Here are the basics of proper training: Training sessions need to be repeatable. Training sessions should put you on the path of progress towards your goals. Training sessions should focus on quality. What is the key to quality? I have a simple answer for most people: control your repetitions.\n \n\\\u003e So, memorize this: Hinge (swings, jumps): deep hip movement, minimal knee movement. Squats: deep hip movement, deep knee movement.\n \n\\\u003e Next, try this little drill. Stand arms-length away from a door knob. Grab the door knob with both hands and get your chest up. Up? Imagine being on a California beach when a swimsuit model walks by. When I have an athlete do this, he will immediately puff up his chest, which tightens the lower back and locks the whole upper body. The lats naturally spread a bit and the shoulders come back a little, too. Doorknob squat with partner Now, lower yourself down.\n \n\\\u003e The full list, if you’re are interested, is here: \n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e - Constant assessment.\n\\\u003e - Constant upgrading.\n\\\u003e - Ignore perfect.\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e This isn’t Moral Theology—there are no “good” or “bad” exercises or training systems. Everything works! Achieving a goal versus success. After the peak is the cliff. Self-discipline is a finite resource. Fundamentals trump everything else. Take a moment to appreciate those who went before you.\n \n\\## Programming the HKC \n\\\u003e - Push\n\\\u003e - Pull\n\\\u003e - Hinge\n\\\u003e - Squat\n\\\u003e - Loaded Carries\n\\\u003e - Everything Else\n \n\\\u003e So, some programming “rules” are emerging: Do all of the fundamental human movements. Push, pull and squat rep numbers must have the same totals. Use the hinge and loaded carry families to improve athletic qualities and work capacity.

First, you figure out what’s worth stealing, then you move on to the next thing. That’s about all there is to it. When you look at the world this way, you stop worrying about what’s “good” and what’s “bad”—there’s only stuff worth stealing, and stuff that’s not worth stealing. Everything is up for grabs. If you don’t find something worth stealing today, you might find it worth stealing tomorrow or a month or a year from now. \n \n\\\u003e What a good artist understands is that nothing comes from nowhere. All creative work builds on what came before. Nothing is completely original. \n \n\\\u003e Your job is to collect good ideas. The more good ideas you collect, the more you can choose from to be influenced by. \n \n\\\u003e Instead, chew on one thinker—writer, artist, activist, role model—you really love. Study everything there is to know about that thinker. Then find three people that thinker loved, and find out everything about them. Repeat this as many times as you can. Climb up the tree as far as you can go. Once you build your tree, it’s time to start your own branch. \n \n\\\u003e It’s not the book you start with, it’s the book that book leads you to. \n \n\\\u003e You might be scared to start. That’s natural. There’s this very real thing that runs rampant in educated people. It’s called “impostor syndrome.” \n \n\\\u003e It means that you feel like a phony, like you’re just winging it, that you really don’t have any idea what you’re doing. \n \n\\\u003e I love both readings—you have to dress for the job you want, not the job you have, and you have to start doing the work you want to be doing. \n \n\\\u003e First, you have to figure out who to copy. Second, you have to figure out what to copy. \n \n\\\u003e If all your favorite makers got together and collaborated, what would they make with you leading the crew? \n \n\\\u003e The manifesto is this: Draw the art you want to see, start the business you want to run, play the music you want to hear, write the books you want to read, build the products you want to use—do the work you want to see done. \n \n\\\u003e “The work you do while you procrastinate is probably the work you should be doing for the rest of your life.” —Jessica Hische \n \n\\\u003e As the writer Steven Pressfield says, “It’s not that people are mean or cruel, they’re just busy.” \n \n\\\u003e Your brain gets too comfortable in your everyday surroundings.

They will even take away our name; and if we want to keep it, we will have to find in ourselves the strength to do so, to manage somehow so that behind the name something of us, of us as we were, still remains.\n \n\\\u003e Besides good fortune, he also possessed another virtue essential for those places: an unlimited capacity for endurance, a silent courage, not innate, not religious, not transcendent, but deliberate and willed hour by hour, a virile patience, which sustained him miraculously to the very edge of collapse.\n \n\\\u003e Many people - many nations - can find themselves holding, more or less wittingly, that ‘every stranger is an enemy’. For the most part this conviction lies deep down like some latent infection; it betrays itself only in random, disconnected acts, and does not lie at the base of a system of reason. But when this does come about, when the unspoken dogma becomes the major premiss in a syllogism, then, at the end of the chain, there is the Lager. Here is the product of a conception of the world carried rigorously to its logical conclusion; so long as the conception subsists the conclusion remains to threaten us. The story of the death camps should be understood by everyone as a sinister alarm-signal.\n \n\\\u003e Only a profound amazement: how can one hit a man without anger?\n \n\\\u003e Sooner or later in life everyone discovers that perfect happiness is unrealizable, but there are few who pause to consider the antithesis: that perfect unhappiness is equally unattainable. The obstacles preventing the realization for both these extreme states are of the same nature: they derive from our human condition which is opposed to everything infinite. Our ever-insufficient knowledge of the future opposes it: and this is called, in the one instance, hope, and in the other, uncertainty of the following day. The certainty of death opposes it: for it places a limit on every joy, but also on every grief. The inevitable material cares oppose it: for as they poison every lasting happiness, they equally assiduously distract us from our misfortunes and make our consciousness of them intermittent and hence supportable.\n \n\\\u003e It grieves me now that I have forgotten his plain, outspoken words, the words of ex-sergeant Steinlauf of the Austro-Hungarian army, Iron Cross of the ‘14-‘18 war. It grieves me because it means that I have to translate his uncertain Italian and his quiet manner of speaking of a good soldier into my language of an incredulous man. But this was the sense, not forgotten either then or later: that precisely because the Lager was a great machine to reduce us to beasts, we must not become beasts; that even in this place one can survive, and therefore one must want to survive, to tell the story, to bear witness; and that to survive we must force ourselves to save at least the skeleton, the scaffolding, the form of civilization. We are slaves deprived of every right, exposed to every insult, condemned to certain death, but we still possess one power, and we must defend it with all our strength for it is the last — the power to reduce our consent. So we must certainly wash our faces without soap in dirty water and dry ourselves on our jackets. We must polish our shoes, not because the regulations states it, but for dignity and propriety. We must walk erect, without dragging our feee, not in homage to Prussian disciple but to remain alive, not to begin to die.\n \n\\\u003e In conclusion: theft in Buna, punished by the civil direction, is authorized and encouraged by the SS; theft in camp, severely repressed by the SS, is considered by the civilians as a normal exchange operation; theft among Haftlinge is generally punished, but the punishment strikes the thief and the victim with equal gravity. We now invite the reader to contemplate the possible meaning in the Lager of the words ‘good’ and ‘evil’, ‘just’ and ‘unjust’; let everybody judge, on the basis of the picture we have outlined and of the examples given above, how much of our ordinary moral world could survive on this side of the barbed wire.\n \n\\\u003e And one must take into account a definite cushioning effect exercising both by the law, and by the moral sense which constitutes a self-imposed law; for a country is considered the more civilized the more the wisdom and efficiency of its law hinder a weak man from becoming too weak or a powerful one too powerful.\n \n\\\u003e For living men, the units of time always have a value, which increases in ratio to the strength of the internal resources of the person living through them; but for us, hours, days, months spilled out sluggishly from the future into the past, always to slowly, a valueless and superfluous material, of which we sought to rid ourselves as soon as possible. With the end of the season when the days chased each other, vivacious, precious and irrecoverable, the future stood in front of us, grey and inarticulate, like an invincible barrier. For us, history has stopped.\n \n\\\u003e It is lucky that it is not windy today. Strange, how in some way one always has the impression of being fortunate, how some chance happenings, perhaps infinitesimal, stops us crossing the threshold of despair and allows us to live. It is raining, but it is not windy. Or else, it is raining and is also windy: but you know that this evening it is your turn for the supplement of soup, so that even today you find the strength to reach the evening. Or it is raining, windy and you have the usual hunger, and then you think that if you really had to, if you really felt nothing in your heart but suffering and tedium — as sometimes happens, when you really seem to lie on the bottom — well, even in that case, at any moment you want you could always go and touch the electric wire-fence, or throw yourself under the shunting trains, and then it would stop raining.\n \n\\\u003e As for the first, it is my brain-child. I knew that the Blockaltester of Block 44 was short of brooms so I stole one in the yard; as far as this goes there is nothing extraordinary. The difficulty was to smuggle the broom into Lager on the return march, and I solved it in what I believe to be a completely original way: I took apart the handle and the head of the broom, sawing the former into two pieces and carrying the various parts separately into camp (the two pieces of the handle tied to my thighs inside my trousers) and then reconstructed the whole article. This required a piece of tin-plate, a hammer and nails to join together the two pieces of wood. The whole business only took four days.\n \n\\\u003e But everything in nature is balanced, there is no offense without defense, every poison has its antidote; it is enough to know what it is.\n \n\\\u003e As the train, more tired than us, climbed towards the Italian frontier it snapped in two like an over-taut cable; there were several injuries, but this was the last adventure. Late at night we crossed the Brenner, which we had passed in our exile twenty months before; our less tired companions celebrated with a cheerful uproar; Leonardo and I remained lost in a silence crowded with memories. Of 650, our number when we had left, three of us were returning. And how much had we lost, in those twenty months? What should we find at home? How much of ourselves had been eroded, extinguished? Were we returning richer or poorer, stronger or emptier? We did not know; but we knew that on the thresholds of our homes, for good or ill, a trial awaited us, and we anticipated it with fear. We felt in our veins the poison of Auschwitz, flowing together with our thin blood; where should we find the strength to begin our lives again, to break down the barriers, the brushwood which grows up spontaneously in all absences, around every deserted house, every empty refuge? Soon, tomorrow, we should have to give battle, against enemies still unknown, outside ourselves and inside; with what weapons, what energies, what willpower? We felt the weight of centuries on our shoulders, we felt oppressed by a year of ferocious memories; we felt emptied and defenseless. The months just past, although hard, of wandering on the margins of civilization now seemed to use like a truce, a parenthesis of unlimited availability, a providential but unrepeatable gift of fate.\n","method":["Physical"],"isbn":"0349100136","isbn13":9780349100135,"rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"reciOequB1Sz3Dcw0"},{"title":"Baby Driver","media":"Movie","date":"2017-07-23","status":"Complete","permalink":"https://letterboxd.com/film/baby-driver/","rating":"★★★★★","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:28:05.000Z","id":"recZXV6kXl16MOw7K"},{"title":"Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder, and One Man's Fight for Justice","media":"Audiobook","creator":"Bill Browder","length":380,"year":"2014","date":"2017-07-20","date_updated":"2017-07-05","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","method":["Audiobook"],"isbn":"147675571X","isbn13":9781476755717,"rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recDuOFD4ltoZrHTe"},{"title":"The War of Art","media":"Book","creator":"Steven Pressfield","length":198,"year":"2002","date":"2017-07-18","date_updated":"2016-10-27","status":"Complete","summary":"\\## FOREWORD\n\\\u003e In short, if the Muse exists, she does not whisper to the untalented. \n \n\\## RESISTANCE'S GREATEST HITS \n\\\u003e In other words, any act that rejects immediate gratification in favor of long-term growth, health, or integrity. Or, expressed another way, any act that derives from our higher nature instead of our lower. Any of these will elicit Resistance. \n \n\\## RESISTANCE IS INVISIBLE \n\\\u003e Resistance cannot be seen, touched, heard, or smelled. But it can be felt. We experience it as an energy field radiating from a work-in-potential. It's a repelling force. It's negative. Its aim is to shove us away, distract us, prevent us from doing our work. \n \n\\## RESISTANCE NEVER SLEEPS \n\\\u003e The warrior and the artist live by the same code of necessity, which dictates that the battle must be fought anew every day. \n \n\\## RESISTANCE IS FUELED BY FEAR \n\\\u003e Resistance has no strength of its own. Every ounce of juice it possesses comes from us. We feed it with power by our fear of it. Master that fear and we conquer Resistance. \n \n\\## RESISTANCE AND PROCRASTINATION, PART TWO \n\\\u003e We don't just put off our lives today; we put them off till our deathbed. \n \n\\\u003e There never was a moment, and never will be, when we are without the power to alter our destiny. \n \n\\## RESISTANCE AND SELF-MEDICATION \n\\\u003e Many pedestrians have been maimed or killed at the intersection of Resistance and Commerce.\n \n\\## RESISTANCE AND VICTIMHOOD \n\\\u003e Casting yourself as a victim is the antithesis of doing your work. Don't do it. If you're doing it, stop. \n \n\\## RESISTANCE AND FUNDAMENTALISM \n\\\u003e These are not easy questions. Who am I? Why am I here? They're not easy because the human being isn't wired to function as an individual. We're wired tribally, to act as part of a group. Our psyches are programmed by millions of years of hunter-gatherer evolution. We know what the clan is; we know how to fit into the band and the tribe. What we don't know is how to be alone. We don't know how to be free individuals. \n \n\\\u003e The paradox seems to be, as Socrates demonstrated long ago, that the truly free individual is free only to the extent of his own self-mastery. While those who will not govern themselves are condemned to find masters to govern over them. \n \n\\## RESISTANCE AND SELF-DOUBT \n\\\u003e Self-doubt can be an ally. This is because it serves as an indicator of aspiration. It reflects love, love of something we dream of doing, and desire, desire to do it. If you find yourself asking yourself (and your friends), \"Am I really a writer? Am I really an artist?\" chances are you are. The counterfeit innovator is wildly self-confident. The real one is scared to death.\n \n\\## RESISTANCE AND FEAR \n\\\u003e Fear tells us what we have to do. \n \n\\\u003e Remember our rule of thumb: The more scared we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we have to do it. \n \n\\## WHAT A WRITER'S DAY FEELS LIKE \n\\\u003e Principle of Priority, which states (a) you must know the difference between what is urgent and what is important, and (b) you must do what's important first. \n \n\\## A PROFESSIONAL SELF-VALIDATES \n\\\u003e The professional cannot allow the actions of others to define his reality. \n \n\\## THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TERRITORY AND HIERARCHY \n\\\u003e Here's another test.

Dead to himself, not to be a self anymore, to find tranquility with an emptied heard, to be open to miracles in unselfish thoughts, that was his goal.\n \n\\\u003e And Siddhartha said quietly, as if he was talking to himself: “What is meditation? What is leaving one’s body? What is fasting? What is holding one’s breath? It is fleeing from the self, it is a short escape of the agony of being a self, it is a short numbing of the senses against the pain and the pointlessness of life. \n \n\\## Second Part \n\\### Kamala\n\\\u003e What might you be able to do?” “I can think. I can wait. I can fast.” \n \n\\### With the Childlike People\n\\\u003e When, for example, Siddhartha hadn’t learned to fast, he would have to accept any kind of service before this day is up, whether it may be with you or wherever, because hunger would force him to do so. But like this, Siddhartha can wait calmly, he knows no impatience, he knows no emergency, for a long time he can allow hunger to besiege him and can laugh about it.\n \n\\\u003e “Writing is good, thinking is better. Being smart is good, being patient is better.”\n \n\\\u003e But he has that mysterious quality of those people to whom success comes all by itself, whether this may be a good star of his birth, magic, or something he has learned among Samanas. He always seems to be merely playing without business-affairs, they never fully become a part of him, they never rule over him, he is never afraid of failure, he is never upset by a loss.”\n \n\\\u003e Most people, Kamala, are like a falling leaf, which is blown and is turning around through the air, and wavers, and tumbles to the ground. But others, a few, are like stars, they go on a fixed course, no wind reaches them, in themselves they have their law and their course. \n \n\\### By the River\n\\\u003e Then, out of remote areas of his soul, out of past times of his now weary life, a sound stirred up. It was a word, a syllable, which he, without thinking, with a slurred voice, spoke to himself, the old word which is the beginning and the end of all prayers of the Brahmans, the holy “Om”, which roughly means “that what is perfect” or “the completion”. And in the moment when the sound of “Om” touched Siddhartha’s ear, his dormant spirit suddenly woke up and realized the foolishness of his actions.\n \n\\\u003e Wondrous indeed was my life, so he thought, wondrous detours it has taken. As I boy, I had only to do with gods and offerings. As a youth, I had only to do with asceticism, with thinking and meditation, was searching for Brahman, worshipped the eternal in the Atman. But as a young man, I followed the penitents, lived in the forest, suffered of heat and frost, learned to hunger, taught my body to become dead. Wonderfully, soon afterwards, insight came towards me in the form of the great Buddha’s teachings, I felt the knowledge of the oneness of the world circling in me like my own blood. But I also had to leave Buddha and the great knowledge. I went and learned the art of love with Kamala, learned trading with Kamaswami, piled up money, wasted money, learned to love my stomach, learned to please my senses. I had to spend many years losing my spirit, to unlearn thinking again, to forget the oneness. Isn’t it just as if I had turned slowly and on a long detour from a man into a child, from a thinker into a childlike person? And yet, this path has been very good; and yet, the bird in my chest has not died. But what a path has this been! I had to pass through so much stupidity, through so much vices, through so many errors, through so much disgust and disappointments and woe, just to become a child again and to be able to start over. But it was right so, my heart says “Yes” to it, my eyes smile to it. I’ve had to experience despair, I’ve had to sink down to the most foolish one of all thoughts, to the thought of suicide, in order to be able to experience divine grace, to hear Om again, to be able to sleep properly and awake properly again. I had to become a fool, to find Atman in me again. I had to sin, to be able to live again. Where else might my path lead me to? It is foolish, this path, it moves in loops, perhaps it is going around in a circle. Let it go as it likes, I want to take it.\n \n\\\u003e “It is good,” he thought, “to get a taste of everything for oneself, which one needs to know. That lust for the world and riches do not belong to the good things, I have already learned as a child. I have known it for a long time, but I have experienced only now. And now I know it, don’t just know it in my memory, but in my eyes, in my heart, in my stomach. Good for me, to know this!” \n \n\\### The Ferryman\n\\\u003e A quiet heart, with a waiting, opened soul, without passion, without a wish, without judgement, without an opinion.\n \n\\\u003e “Yes, Siddhartha,” he spoke. “It is this what you mean, isn’t it: that the river is everywhere at once, at the source and at the mouth, at the waterfall, at the ferry, at the rapids, in the sea, in the mountains, everywhere at once, and that there is only the present time for it, not the shadow of the past, not the shadow of the future?” “This it is,” said Siddhartha. “And when I had learned it, I looked at my life, and it was also a river, and the boy Siddhartha was only separated from the man Siddhartha and from the old man Siddhartha by a shadow, not by something real. Also, Siddhartha’s previous births were no past, and his death and his return to Brahma was no future. Nothing was, nothing will be; everything is, everything has existence and is present.” \n \n\\### The Son\n\\\u003e Through all this, the son let him commit his foolish acts, let him court for his affection, let him humiliate himself every day by giving in to his moods. \n \n\\### Govinda\n\\\u003e Wisdom which a wise man tries to pass on to someone always sounds like foolishness.” \n \n\\\u003e The opposite of every truth is just as true! That’s like this: any truth can only be expressed and put into words when it is one-sided. Everything is one-sided which can be thought with thoughts and said with words, it’s all one-sided, all just one half, all lacks completeness, roundness, oneness.\n \n\\\u003e It is not possible for any person to see how far another one has already progressed on his path.\n \n\\\u003e I see whatever exists as good, death is to me like life, sin like holiness, wisdom like foolishness, everything has to be as it is, everything only requires my consent, only my willingness, my loving agreement, to be good for me, to do nothing but work for my benefit, to be unable to ever harm me. \n \n\\## Vocabulary\n\n\\- Ablutions - a cleansing with water or other liquid, especially as a religious ritual\n\\- Castigation - to criticize or reprimand severely\n","method":["Digital"],"rating":"★★★☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recvehiU5TuYkm2bk"},{"title":"8 Weeks to SEALFIT: A Navy SEAL's Guide to Unconventional Training for Physical and Mental Toughness","media":"Book","creator":"Mark Divine","length":272,"year":"2011","date":"2017-06-23","date_updated":"2017-06-21","status":"Complete","summary":"\\## 1.

Staying in the Fight\n\\\u003e“Let the hammer hit your funny bone.” Rather than curl up and hunker down to ride out the storm, make light of the situation and find the lesson lurking inside. \n\\\u003e\n\\\u003eToday’s first assignment: Grab your journal, sit quietly, and reflect upon which four dominant emotions drive your behavior. Do you operate out of fear? Anger? Jealousy? Love? Joy? Courage? Be brutally honest with yourself. No one’s watching. Write your four down. It’s very important. \n\\\u003e\n\\\u003eGot your four down? Good. Now, answer the following questions: 1. What do these emotions keep me from creating in my life? 2. What beliefs create these four emotions? 3. What would I be like, and what would my life be like, if I could control these emotions?\n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e1. What benefit would it bring me and others if I acted with these ideal emotions? \n\\\u003e2. What beliefs do I need to change, and what new beliefs do I need to develop, to own these ideal emotions? \n\\\u003e3. What would I be like and what would my life be like, if I replaced my original four dominant emotions with these four ideal emotions?\n\\\u003e\n\\\u003eReflect on your answers daily for the next 3 weeks. After 21 days your new beliefs and emotions will begin to form habits, which will define your new character. \n\\\u003e\n\\\u003eYour goal is not to just stay in the fight, but to crush it every time! \n\n\\\u003eWARM-UP: Watch butterfly sit-ups, kettlebell swings, and push-up videos (www.sealfit.com/ videos). Then perform ROM drills, then 10 perfect reps of each exercise in work capacity. \n\\\u003e\n\\\u003eWORK CAPACITY: Complete 21–15–9 reps as fast as possible, with great forms, of:\n\\\u003e- butterfly sit-ups \n\\\u003e- kettlebell swings \n\\\u003e- push-ups \n\\\u003e- 400m run after each set of repetitions \n\\\u003e\n\\\u003eCOOL DOWN: 1-mile walk or jog and long stretch. \n\\\u003e\n\\\u003eCOACHING NOTES: Hydrate and refuel. Journal your results. Perform 21 of each exercise, then 15 of each, then 9 of each. \n\n\\## 4. Training Isn’t “Working Out”\n\n\\\u003eTraining is passionately applying carefully conceived principles to develop yourself physically, mentally, and spiritually. It cultivates a deep awareness of your inner and outer worlds and aligns these worlds into a serious force. You show up as exceptional every day. \n\n\\\u003eWARM-UP: Watch rowing and box jumps videos (www.sealfit.com/ videos). Then perform ROM drills, then 50 air squats, then 25 tuck jumps (knee to chest). \n\\\u003e\n\\\u003eWORK CAPACITY: 5 rounds for quality and time of: \n\\\u003e- 15 × box jumps (20 or 24 inches) \n\\\u003e- 18 × sit-ups \n\\\u003e- 20 × air squats \n\\\u003e- 500m row (substitute 500m sprint if you do not have a rower) \n\\\u003e\n\\\u003eCOOL DOWN: jog or walk 1 mile. Stretch or SEALFIT Yoga (see chapter 7). \n\\\u003e\n\\\u003eCOACHING NOTES: Hydrate, refuel, and journal results. This workout is about sustained workload across a broad time domain. It should take you around 30 minutes. \n\n\\## 5. The Five Mountains\n\n\\\u003eMark Rippetoe: “Strong people are harder to kill than weak people, and more useful in general.”\n \n\\\u003eThe Observe, Orient, Decide, Act (OODA) loop is the decision tool I teach for this skill. \n\n\\\u003eRespect literally means to revisit or take another look at something. \nTHE FIVE MOUNTAIN MISSION Pain is weakness leaving the body.—NAVY SEALS WARM-UP: Watch grinder PT (physical training) intro and do warm-up (www.sealfit.com/ videos). Then do pretraining SOP and ROM drills. \n\n\\\u003eWORK CAPACITY AND STAMINA: Grinder PT—1, 2, or 3 rounds of the following as fast as possible with good form: \n\\\u003e\n\\\u003e- 10 × run and drop \n\\\u003e- 10 × DB (dumbbell) \n\\\u003e- 15 × squat jumps (20–40-pound dumbbells) \n\\\u003e- 20 × push-ups \n\\\u003e- 20 × leg levers \n\\\u003e- 15 × burpees \n\\\u003e- 10 × DB (dumbbell) squat jumps (20–40-pound dumbbells) \n\\\u003e- 20 × push-ups \n\\\u003e- 20 × leg levers \n\\\u003e- 15 × burpees \n\\\u003e- 15 × 4-count smurf jumping jacks \n\\\u003e- 15 × tuck jumps \n\\\u003e- 20 × DB thrusters (front squat followed by a push press in 1 flowing motion) \n\\\u003e- 20 × push-ups (narrow) \n\\\u003e- 20 × crisscross jumping jacks \n\\\u003e\n\\\u003eCOOL DOWN: 1-mile jog or walk. Stretch or SEALFIT yoga. \n\n\\## 6.

On-Ramp Training\n\n\\\u003e\\3. The Morning Ritual The goal of the morning ritual is to engage your body and mind in a positive manner. You will connect to your purpose, cultivate your optimism and positivity, and ensure that your next actions of the day move the dial toward your goals. We want to energize your physiology and psychology for optimal performance! \n\\\u003e\n\\\u003e#### STEP 1: Drink a large glass of water, then, sitting comfortably with your journal, ask yourself these empowering questions:\n\\\u003e\n\\\u003e- What and whom am I grateful for today? (Write down what comes up. Cultivate an attitude of gratitude!) \n\\\u003e- What am I excited about and looking forward to doing today? \n\\\u003e- What is my purpose and do my plans for today connect me to it? \n\\\u003e- What can I do to move the dial toward my purpose goals today? \n\\\u003e- Who can I reach out to and serve or thank today? Review your goals and ensure they are still aligned with your purpose. \n\\\u003e\n\\\u003e#### STEP 2: Morning practice. Set up your space and settle into your morning practice. \n\\\u003e\n\\\u003e- Box breathing practice; 5 minutes. \n\\\u003e- SEALFIT Yoga: 10–45 minutes (you can substitute Qi Gong, a light workout, or a brisk walk here). \n\\\u003e- From resting pose after your movement conduct a short breath awareness meditation: 5 minutes. \n\\\u003e- Visualization or guided visualization: 5 minutes. \n\\\u003e- Shower up and get ready for your day. \n\\\u003e- Drink another glass of fresh water, and eat a healthy Paleo breakfast. \n\\\u003e\n\\\u003e#### STEP 3: Before you leave for work, review your daily schedule.\n\\\u003e\n\\\u003eMake any adjustments and block time for key project work and your physical training. When you get to your place of work, start performing and don’t let others take you off task, off focus, or off purpose. Use your presence practices to stay focused and energized throughout the day. Avoid food and drink that steals your energy (junk food, candy, excessive coffee, Rockstars, 5-hour energy drinks, etc.).\n\n\\## Appendix \n\n\\### 4.

I thought it was kind of amusing. \n \n\\## Part 5 THE WORLD OF ONE PHYSICIST \n\\### Is Electricity Fire?\n\\\u003e I had this uneasy feeling of “I’m not adequate,” until finally I said to myself, “I’m gonna stop, and read one sentence slowly, so I can figure out what the hell it means.” So I stopped—at random—and read the next sentence very carefully. I can’t remember it precisely, but it was very close to this: “The individual member of the social community often receives his information via visual, symbolic channels.” I went back and forth over it, and translated. You know what it means? “People read.” \n \n\\### Cargo Cult Science\n\\\u003e I think the educational and psychological studies I mentioned are examples of what I would like to call cargo cult science. In the South Seas there is a cargo cult of people. During the war they saw airplanes land with lots of good materials, and they want the same thing to happen now. So they’ve arranged to make things like runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head like headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas—he’s the controller—and they wait for the airplanes to land. They’re doing everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked before. But it doesn’t work. No airplanes land. So I call these things cargo cult science, because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of scientific investigation, but they’re missing something essential, because the planes don’t land.\n \n\\# Vocabulary\n\n\\- Kowtow - act in an excessively subservient manner\n","method":["Digital"],"rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"rec8X9c5fF7R3YR5m"},{"title":"Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life...And Maybe the World","media":"Book","creator":"William H.

King Agis was shown a new catapult, which could shoot a killing dart 200 yards. When he saw this, he wept. “Alas,” he said. “Valor is no more.” \n \n\\\u003e There was a footrace in Sparta each year among the boys. They ran ten miles, barefoot, carrying a mouthful of water. The boys were not allowed to swallow any of the water but had to spit it all out at the end of the race. \n \n\\## PART THREE \n\\\u003e Let us conduct ourselves so that all men wish to be our friends and all fear to be our enemies. \n \n\\\u003e Fix your mind upon its object.

One of Alexander’s zealous young lieutenants took it upon himself to chase the holy men out of the king’s path. When one of the wise men resisted, the officer started verbally abusing him. Just then, Alexander came up. The lieutenant pointed to Alexander and said to the yogi, “This man has conquered the world! What have you accomplished?” The yogi looked up calmly and replied, “I have conquered the need to conquer the world.” At this, Alexander laughed with approval. He admired the naked wise men. “Could I be any man in the world other than myself,” he said, “I would be this man here.” \n","method":["Digital"],"isbn":"0374275637","isbn13":9780374275631,"rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recAZeB1yAmX2wyMz"},{"title":"Billy Boy","media":"Book","creator":"Bud Shrake","length":240,"year":"2001","date":"2017-05-02","date_updated":"2017-05-02","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","method":["Digital"],"rating":"★★★☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recoTwPkIq3sGxxuj"},{"title":"The 1997 Masters: My Story","media":"Book","creator":"Tiger Woods","length":256,"year":"2017","date":"2017-04-24","date_updated":"2017-04-04","status":"Complete","summary":"\\## Chapter Two: Amateur Days at the Masters\n\\\u003e It’s never good when you hit a putt and people start to move. \n","method":["Digital"],"isbn":"1455543586","isbn13":9781455543588,"rating":"★★★☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recrEGXAvPIyDDHLH"},{"title":"Girls","media":"TV","date":"2017-04-16","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","season":"Season 6","rating":"★★★★★","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:33:35.000Z","id":"recoi0PmP6CFDRXVz"},{"title":"Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers","media":"Book","creator":"Timothy Ferriss","length":707,"year":"2016","date":"2017-03-16","date_updated":"2016-10-28","status":"Complete","summary":"\\## Read This First—How to Use This Book \n\\\u003e In this book, you’ll naturally look for common habits and recommendations, and you should. Here are a few patterns, some odder than others: More than 80% of the interviewees have some form of daily mindfulness or meditation practice A surprising number of males (not females) over 45 never eat breakfast, or eat only the scantiest of fare (e.g., Laird Hamilton, page 92; Malcolm Gladwell, page 572; General Stanley McChrystal, page 435) Many use the ChiliPad device for cooling at bedtime Rave reviews of the books Sapiens, Poor Charlie’s Almanack, Influence, and Man’s Search for Meaning, among others The habit of listening to single songs on repeat for focus (page 507) Nearly everyone has done some form of “spec” work (completing projects on their own time and dime, then submitting them to prospective buyers) The belief that “failure is not durable” (see Robert Rodriguez, page 628) or variants thereof Almost every guest has been able to take obvious “weaknesses” and turn them into huge competitive advantages (see Arnold Schwarzenegger, page 176) \n \n\\## Christopher Sommer \n\\\u003e When in doubt, work on the deficiencies you’re most embarrassed by. \n \n\\\u003e “Flexibility” can be passive, whereas “mobility” requires that you can demonstrate strength throughout the entire range of motion, including the end ranges. \n \n\\## Dominic D’Agostino \n\\\u003e Cancer as a Metabolic Disease by Thomas Seyfried: required reading for all of Dom’s students Tripping Over the Truth by Travis Christofferson: Dom has gifted this to seven or eight people over the last year The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief by Francis Collins \n \n\\## Joe De Sena \n\\\u003e “Breathe, motherfucker! ” \n \n\\## Deconstructing Sports and Skills with Questions \n\\\u003e “The quality of your questions determines the quality of your life.”\n \n\\\u003e Who is good at \\*SPORT\\* despite being poorly built for it? Who’s good at this who shouldn’t be? Who are the most controversial or unorthodox athletes or trainers in \\*SPORT\\*? Why? What do you think of them? Who are the most impressive lesser-known teachers? What makes you different? Who trained you or influenced you? Have you trained others to do this? Have they replicated your results? What are the biggest mistakes and myths you see in \\*SPORT\\* training? What are the biggest wastes of time? What are your favorite instructional books or resources on the subject? If people had to teach themselves, what would you suggest they use? If you were to train me for 12 weeks for a \\*FILL IN BLANK\\* competition and had a million dollars on the line, what would the training look like? What if I trained for 8 weeks? \n \n\\## Peter Attia \n\\\u003e \\*\\*Rule #1: \\*\\*Avoid “white” starchy carbohydrates (or those that can be white). This means all bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, and grains (yes, including quinoa). If you have to ask, don’t eat it.\n\\\u003e\n\\\u003e \\*\\*Rule #2:\\*\\* Eat the same few meals over and over again, especially for breakfast and lunch. Good news: You already do this. You’re just picking new default meals. If you want to keep it simple, split your plate into thirds: protein, veggies, and beans/ legumes.\n\\\u003e\n\\\u003e \\*\\*Rule #3:\\*\\* Don’t drink calories. Exception: 1 to 2 glasses of dry red wine per night is allowed, although this can cause some peri-/ post-menopausal women to plateau.\n\\\u003e\n\\\u003e \\*\\*Rule #4:\\*\\* Don’t eat fruit. (Fructose → glycerol phosphate → more body fat, more or less.) Avocado and tomatoes are allowed.\n\\\u003e\n\\\u003e \\*\\*Rule #5:\\*\\* Whenever possible, measure your progress in body fat percentage, NOT total pounds. The scale can deceive and derail you. For instance, it’s common to gain muscle while simultaneously losing fat on the SCD. That’s exactly what you want, but the scale number won’t move, and you will get frustrated. In place of the scale, I use DEXA scans, a BodyMetrix home ultrasound device, or calipers with a gym professional (I recommend the Jackson-Pollock 7-point method). And then:\n\\\u003e\n\\\u003e \\*\\*Rule #6:\\*\\* Take one day off per week and go nuts. I choose and recommend Saturday. This is “cheat day,” which a lot of readers also call “Faturday.” For biochemical and psychological reasons, it’s important not to hold back. Some readers keep a “to-eat” list during the week, which reminds them that they’re only giving up vices for 6 days at a time. Comprehensive step-by-step details, including Q\u0026 As and troubleshooting, can be found in The 4-Hour Body, but the preceding outline is often enough to lose 20 pounds in a month, and drop 2 clothing sizes. \n \n\\## Pavel Tsatsouline \n\\\u003e Two Warmups: Halos and Cossack Squats \n \n\\\u003e 3 High-Yield Exercises—Pavel’s “Simple \u0026 Sinister” Kettlebell Program One-arm swing Turkish get-up (TGU) Goblet squat \n \n\\\u003e Among effective midsection exercises are ‘power breathing,’ hollow rocks, Janda sit-ups, hanging leg raises, and ‘hard-style planks.’ To do the last, hold a plank for 10 seconds under max contraction, not for several minutes. Hold it like you’re about to be kicked and breathe ‘behind the shield’ of your tensed midsection. For a challenge, consider putting your feet on the wall, a few inches from the floor.” \n \n\\\u003e “Grease the Groove” for Strength Endurance and Strength “To increase your pull-up numbers, start doing half the reps you’re capable of (e.g., sets of 4 if your personal best is 8) in repeated sets throughout the day. Simply accumulate reps with at least 15 minutes between sets, and adjust the daily volume to always feel fresh.” Using GTG for several months, Pavel’s father-in-law went from 10 to 20 strict pull-ups at age 64—and he could not do that many when he was a young Marine. The minimum of 15 minutes’ rest is necessary for creatine phosphate hypercompensation. “Whereas most strength-endurance programs work by training one to tolerate more lactic acid, GTG instead trains one to produce less acid. It increases the quantity and quality of mitochondria in fast-twitch muscle fibers and makes them more aerobic.” If you are “greasing the groove” for a maximal strength movement, do not exceed 5 reps per set. In this case, the method works through a different mechanism (for the nerds: synaptic facilitation and myelination). Let’s say you’re working up to a single perfect rep of a one-armed push-up. In your progression, you might do one-armed push-ups with feet on the floor and hands on the edge of a table or counter. If 6 reps is your max, you would do GTG sets of no more than 2 to 3 reps. \n \n\\## Paul Levesque (Triple H) \n\\\u003e “I’d never heard it said that way, but it stuck with me. So much so that I’ve said it to my kid now: ‘Is that a dream, or a goal? Because a dream is something you fantasize about that will probably never happen. A goal is something you set a plan for, work toward, and achieve. I always looked at my stuff that way. The people who were successful models to me were people who had structured goals and then put a plan in place to get to those things. \n \n\\\u003e Whitney Cummings (page 477) told me something similar, on big standup specials: “My work isn’t done tonight. My work was done 3 months ago, and I just have to show up.” \n \n\\\u003e This led me to ask myself, usually during my quarterly 80/ 20 reviews of stress points, etc., “What am I continuing to do myself that I’m not good at?” Improve it, eliminate it, or delegate it. \n \n\\## Jane McGonigal \n\\\u003e “‘ Any useful statement about the future should at first seem ridiculous’ by Jim Dator. Also, ‘When it comes to the future, it’s far more important to be imaginative than to be right’ by Alvin Toffler. Both are famous futurists. These quotes remind me that world-changing ideas will seem absurd to most people, and that the most useful work I can be doing is to push the envelope of what is considered possible. If what I’m doing sounds reasonable to most people, then I’m not working in a space that is creative and innovative enough!” \n \n\\## 5 Morning Rituals that Help Me Win the Day \n\\\u003e I am grateful for...\n\\\u003e 1. \n\\\u003e 2. \n\\\u003e 3. \n\\\u003e What would make today great? \n\\\u003e 1. \n\\\u003e 2. \n\\\u003e 3. \n\\\u003e Daily affirmations.

At the end of a thought, notice that the thought is over. Gone. At the end of an experience of emotion—joy, anger, sadness, or anything else—notice it is over. Gone. \n \n\\\u003e In many of my public talks, I guide a very simple 10-second exercise. I tell the audience members to each identify two human beings in the room and just think, “I wish for this person to be happy, and I wish for that person to be happy.” That is it. I remind them to not do or say anything, just think—this is an entirely thinking exercise. The entire exercise is just 10 seconds’ worth of thinking. \n \n\\## Coach Sommer—The Single Decision \n\\\u003e Strength improvements [for a movement like this] take a minimum of 6 weeks. Any perceived improvements prior to that are simply the result of improved synaptic facilitation. In plain English, the central nervous system simply became more efficient at that particular movement with practice. This is, however, not to be confused with actual strength gains. \n \n\\\u003e The secret is to show up, do the work, and go home. A blue collar work ethic married to indomitable will. \n \n\\## Chris Sacca \n\\\u003e “Weirdness is why we adore our friends....Weirdness is what bonds us to our colleagues.

In fact, being weird may even find you the ultimate happiness.” \n \n\\## Marc Andreessen \n\\\u003e “Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call ‘life’ was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.” \n \n\\## Derek Sivers \n\\\u003e “What if you asked, ‘When you think of the word “successful,” who’s the third person that comes to mind? Why are they actually more successful than the first person that came to mind?’ \n \n\\\u003e This is genius. Ricardo Semler, CEO and majority owner of the Brazil-based Semco Partners, practices asking “Why?” three times. This is true when questioning his own motives, or when tackling big projects. The rationale is identical to Derek’s. \n \n\\\u003e “Every time people contact me, they say, ‘Look, I know you must be incredibly busy . . .’ and I always think, ‘No, I’m not.’ Because I’m in control of my time. I’m on top of it. ‘Busy,’ to me, seems to imply ‘out of control.’ Like, ‘Oh my God, I’m so busy. I don’t have any time for this shit!’ \n \n\\\u003e Lack of time is lack of priorities. If I’m “busy,” it is because I’ve made choices that put me in that position, so I’ve forbidden myself to reply to “How are you?” with “Busy.” I have no right to complain. Instead, if I’m too busy, it’s a cue to reexamine my systems and rules. \n \n\\\u003e When you make a business, you’re making a little world where you control the laws. It doesn’t matter how things are done everywhere else. In your little world, you can make it like it should be. \n \n\\## Alexis Ohanian \n\\\u003e A Damn-Giving Assignment of Less Than 15 Minutes Improve a notification email from your business (e.g., subscription confirmation, order confirmation, whatever): “Invest that little bit of time to make it a little bit more human or—depending on your brand—a little funnier, a little more different, or a little more whatever. It’ll be worth it, and that’s my challenge.” \n \n\\\u003e Alexis has many approaches, of course, but I liked this example of what Cal Fussman (page 495) might call “letting the silence do the work”: “I really think a lot can be conveyed with a raised eyebrow.” \n \n\\## “Productivity” Tricks for the Neurotic, Manic-Depressive, and Crazy (Like Me) \n\\\u003e “The moment that you feel that, just possibly, you’re walking down the street naked, exposing too much of your heart and your mind and what exists on the inside, showing too much of yourself. That’s the moment you may be starting to get it right.” —Neil Gaiman, University of the Arts commencement speech \n \n\\## Tony Robbins \n\\\u003e “It’s a belief: Life is always happening for us, not to us. It’s our job to find out where the benefit is. If we do, life is magnificent.” \n \n\\\u003e “Losers react, leaders anticipate.” \n \n\\\u003e Jim Rohn famously said, “If you let your learning lead to knowledge, you become a fool. If you let your learning lead to action, you become wealthy.” \n \n\\\u003e Following something like the above, Tony does 9 to 10 minutes of what some might consider meditation. To him, however, the objective is very different: It’s about cueing and prompting enabling emotions for the rest of the day. His 9 to 10 minutes are broken into thirds. Here is an abbreviated synopsis: The first 3 minutes: “Feeling totally grateful for three things. I make sure that one of them is very, very simple: the wind on my face, the reflection of the clouds that I just saw. But I don’t just think gratitude. I let gratitude fill my soul, because when you’re grateful, we all know there’s no anger. It’s impossible to be angry and grateful simultaneously. When you’re grateful, there is no fear. You can’t be fearful and grateful simultaneously.” The second 3 minutes: “Total focus on feeling the presence of God, if you will, however you want to language that for yourself. But this inner presence coming in, and feeling it heal everything in my body, in my mind, my emotions, my relationships, my finances. I see it as solving anything that needs to be solved. I experience the strengthening of my gratitude, of my conviction, of my passion. . . .” The last 3 minutes: “Focusing on three things that I’m going to make happen, my ‘three to thrive.’...See it as though it’s already been done, feel the emotions, etc....\n \n\\## What My Morning Journal Looks Like \n\\\u003e “Once we get those muddy, maddening, confusing thoughts [nebulous worries, jitters, and preoccupations] on the page, we face our day with clearer eyes.” \n \n\\## Peter Thiel \n\\\u003e So if you’re planning to do something with your life, if you have a 10-year plan of how to get there, you should ask: Why can’t you do this in 6 months? \n \n\\\u003e There is something very odd about a society where the most talented people all get tracked toward the same elite colleges, where they end up studying the same small number of subjects and going into the same small number of careers. \n \n\\## Seth Godin \n\\\u003e ‘First, Ten,’ and it is a simple theory of marketing that says: tell ten people, show ten people, share it with ten people; ten people who already trust you and already like you. If they don’t tell anybody else, it’s not that good and you should start over. If they do tell other people, you’re on your way.” \n \n\\\u003e “Deep down, I am certain that people are plastic in the positive sense: flexible and able to grow. I think almost everything is made, not born, and that makes people uncomfortable because it puts them on the hook, but I truly believe it.” \n \n\\## James Altucher \n\\\u003e “What if \\*you\\* just can’t come up with 10 ideas? Here’s the magic trick: If you can’t come up with 10 ideas, come up with 20 ideas....You are putting too much pressure on yourself. Perfectionism is the \\*\\*ENEMY\\*\\* of the idea muscle...it’s your brain trying to protect you from harm, from coming up with an idea that is embarrassing and stupid and could cause you to suffer pain. The way you shut \\*this\\* off is by forcing \\*the brain\\* to come up with bad ideas. \n \n\\\u003e In his words, but condensed for space, here are some examples of the types of lists James makes: 10 old ideas I can make new 10 ridiculous things I would invent (e.g., the smart toilet) 10 books I can write (The Choose Yourself Guide to an Alternative Education, etc). 10 business ideas for Google/ Amazon/ Twitter/ etc. 10 people I can send ideas to 10 podcast ideas or videos I can shoot (e.g., Lunch with James, a video podcast where I just have lunch with people over Skype and we chat) 10 industries where I can remove the middleman 10 things I disagree with that everyone else assumes is religion (college, home ownership, voting, doctors, etc.) 10 ways to take old posts of mine and make books out of them 10 people I want to be friends with (then figure out the first step to contact them) 10 things I learned yesterday 10 things I can do differently today 10 ways I can save time 10 things I learned from X, where X is someone I’ve recently spoken with or read a book by or about. I’ve written posts on this about the Beatles, Mick Jagger, Steve Jobs, Charles Bukowski, the Dalai Lama, Superman, Freakonomics, etc. 10 things I’m interested in getting better at (and then 10 ways I can get better at each one) 10 things I was interested in as a kid that might be fun to explore now (Like, maybe I can write that “Son of Dr. Strange” comic I’ve always been planning.

It’s about providing the support so that others can be good. The better wording for the advice is this: Find canvases for other people to paint on. Be an anteambulo. Clear the path for the people above you and you will eventually create a path for yourself. \n \n\\\u003e That’s what the canvas strategy is about—helping yourself by helping others. Making a concerted effort to trade your short-term gratification for a longer-term payoff. Whereas everyone else wants to get credit and be “respected,” you can forget credit. You can forget it so hard that you’re glad when others get it instead of you—that was your aim, after all. Let the others take their credit on credit, while you defer and earn interest on the principal. \n \n\\## Peter Diamandis \n\\\u003e “A problem is a terrible thing to waste.” \n \n\\\u003e One of the books he recommends for cultivating dealmaking ability is actually a children’s book and a 10-minute read: Stone Soup. “It’s a children’s story that is the best MBA degree you can read.

Meaning: When deciding whether to commit to something, if I feel anything less than “Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hell yeah!”—then my answer is no. When you say no to most things, you leave room in your life to really throw yourself completely into that rare thing that makes you say, “HELL YEAH!” We’re all busy. We’ve all taken on too much. Saying yes to less is the way out. \n \n\\\u003e One of my favorite time-management essays is “Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule” by Paul Graham of Y Combinator fame. Give it a read. \n \n\\\u003e Life favors the specific ask and punishes the vague wish. \n \n\\## BJ Miller \n\\\u003e “When you are struggling with just about anything, look up. Just ponder the night sky for a minute and realize that we’re all on the same planet at the same time. As far as we can tell, we’re the only planet with life like ours on it anywhere nearby. Then you start looking at the stars, and you realize that the light hitting your eye is ancient, [some of the] stars that you’re seeing, they no longer exist by the time that the light gets to you. Just mulling the bare-naked facts of the cosmos is enough to thrill me, awe me, freak me out, and kind of put all my neurotic anxieties in their proper place. A lot of people—when you’re standing at the edge of your horizon, at death’s door, you can be much more in tune with the cosmos.” \n \n\\## Jocko Willink \n\\\u003e If you’re open to reading a “dark” book to help put things in perspective, If This Is a Man and The Truce (often combined into one volume) by Primo Levi are two of my favorites. \n \n\\\u003e “I’m up and getting after it by 4:45. I like to have that psychological win over the enemy. For me, when I wake up in the morning—and I don’t know why—I’m thinking about the enemy and what they’re doing. I know I’m not on active duty anymore, but it’s still in my head: that there’s a guy in a cave somewhere, he’s rocking back and forth, and he’s got a machine gun in one hand and a grenade in the other. He’s waiting for me, and we’re going to meet. When I wake up in the morning, I’m thinking to myself: What can I do to be ready for that moment, which is coming? That propels me out of bed.” \n \n\\\u003e “I would never have guessed this. First of all, the sensation, just holding that snowball. But also the implied, inherent perspective that it helped me have. That everything changes. Snow becomes water. It’s beautiful because it changes. Things are fleeting. It felt so beautiful to be part of this weird world in that moment. I felt part of the world again, rather than removed from it. It was potent.” \n \n\\## Maria Popova \n\\\u003e “Guilt is interesting because guilt is the flip side of prestige, and they’re both horrible reasons to do things.” \n \n\\\u003e “All those artists and writers who bemoan how hard the work is, and oh, how tedious the creative process, and oh, what a tortured genius they are. Don’t buy into it....As if difficulty and struggle and torture somehow confer seriousness upon your chosen work. Doing great work simply because you love it, sounds, in our culture, somehow flimsy, and that’s a failing of our culture, not of the choice of work that artists make.” \n \n\\\u003e “Thoreau writes, ‘The really efficient laborer will be found not to crowd his day with work, but will saunter to his task surrounded by a wide halo of ease and leisure. There will be a wide margin for relaxation to his day. He is only earnest to secure the kernels of time, and does not exaggerate the value of the husk.’ Think of what a beautiful metaphor this is for not mistaking the husk—the outer accoutrements of productivity like busyness, or a full calendar, or a clever auto-responder—not mistaking those for the kernel, the core and substance of the actual work produced. And he then says, ‘Those who work much, do not work hard.’ I love that.” \n \n\\\u003e You discover your ‘dream’ (or sense of purpose) in the very act of walking the path, which is guided by equal parts choice and chance.” \n \n\\\u003e “You can’t blame your boss for not giving you the support you need. Plenty of people will say, ‘It’s my boss’s fault.’ No, it’s actually your fault because you haven’t educated him, you haven’t influenced him, you haven’t explained to him in a manner he understands why you need this support that you need. That’s extreme ownership. Own it all.” \n \n\\## The Dickens Process—What Are Your Beliefs Costing You? \n\\\u003e In A Christmas Carol, Scrooge is visited by the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future. In the Dickens Process, you’re forced to examine limiting beliefs—say, your top two or three handicapping beliefs—across each tense. Tony guides you through each in depth, and I recall answering and visualizing variations of: What has each belief cost you in the past, and what has it cost people you’ve loved in the past? What have you lost because of this belief? See it, hear it, feel it. What is each costing you and people you care about in the present? See it, hear it, feel it. What will each cost you and people you care about 1, 3, 5, and 10 years from now? See it, hear it, feel it. \n \n\\## Sam Harris \n\\\u003e landscape that was worth exploring....“The sense of being a self riding around in your head—this feeling that everyone calls ‘I’—is an illusion that can be disconfirmed in a variety of ways....It’s vulnerable to inquiry, and that inquiry can take many forms. \n \n\\## My Favorite Thought Exercise: Fear-Setting \n\\\u003e What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do. As I have heard said, a person’s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have. Resolve to do one thing every day that you fear. I got into this habit by attempting to contact celebrities and famous businesspeople for advice. \n \n\\## Kevin Kelly \n\\\u003e In a world of distraction, single-tasking is a superpower.\n \n\\\u003e Write to Get Ideas, Not to Express Them “What I discovered, which is what many writers discover, is that I write in order to think. I’d say, ‘I think I have an idea,’ but when I begin to write it, I realize, ‘I have no idea,’ and I don’t actually know what I think until I try and write it....That was the revelation.” \n \n\\\u003e One of his tools for coming up with unbelievable (yet ultimately accurate) predictions is making a list of what everyone thinks is true or will be true, and asking “What if that weren’t true?” for each, brainstorming the ramifications. \n \n\\\u003e ‘What’s the worst that can happen? Well, the worst that can happen is that I’d have a backpack and a sleeping bag, and I’d be eating oatmeal. And I’d be fine.’” \n \n\\## Is This What I So Feared? \n\\\u003e “Our life is frittered away by detail....Simplify, simplify....A man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone.” —Henry David Thoreau, Walden \n \n\\## Whitney Cummings \n\\\u003e ‘Comedians become comedians so they can control why people laugh at them.’ \n \n\\\u003e “the way you do anything is the way you do everything.” \n \n\\## Alain de Botton \n\\\u003e “Wasn’t it Bill Clinton who said that when dealing with anyone who’s upset, he always asks, ‘Has this person slept? Have they eaten? Is somebody else bugging them?’ He goes through this simple checklist....When we’re handling babies and the baby is kicking and crying, we almost never once say, ‘That baby’s out to get me’ or ‘She’s got evil intentions.’” \n \n\\## Lazy: A Manifesto \n\\\u003e I recently learned a neologism that, like political correctness, man cave, and content-provider, I instantly recognized as heralding an ugly new turn in the culture: planshopping. That is, deferring committing to any one plan for an evening until you know what all your options are, and then picking the one that’s most likely to be fun/ advance your career/ have the most girls at it—in other words, treating people like menu options or products in a catalog. \n \n\\## Amanda Palmer \n\\\u003e Honor those who seek the truth, beware of those who’ve found it’ (adapted from Voltaire). \n \n\\## Naval Ravikant \n\\\u003e All of the value in life, including in relationships, comes from compound interest. \n \n\\\u003e “In any situation in life, you only have three options. You always have three options. You can change it, you can accept it, or you can leave it. \n \n\\\u003e “Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.” \n \n\\\u003e Anger is a hot coal that you hold in your hand while waiting to throw it at someone else (Buddhist saying). \n \n\\\u003e All the real benefits in life come from compound interest. \n \n\\\u003e Praise specifically, criticize generally (Warren Buffett). \n \n\\## Glenn Beck \n\\\u003e “Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason, than that of blindfolded fear.”—Thomas Jefferson \n \n\\## Josh Waitzkin \n\\\u003e Whereas most competitors are secretive about their competition prep, Marcelo routinely records and uploads his sparring sessions, his exact training for major events. Josh explains the rationale: “Marcelo was visually showing these competitors what he was about to use against them at 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks (away from competition), and his attitude about this was just completely unique: ‘If you’re studying my game, you’re entering my game, and I’ll be better at it than you.’” \n \n\\\u003e He can turn it off so deeply, and man, when he goes in the ring, you can’t turn it on with any more intensity than he can. His ability to turn it off is directly aligned with how intensely he can turn it on, so I train people to do this, to have stress and recovery undulation throughout their day. \n \n\\## Testing the “Impossible”: 17 Questions that Changed My Life \n\\\u003e Another way I often approach this is to look at my to-do list and ask: “Which one of these, if done, would render all the rest either easier or completely irrelevant?” \n \n\\## “Good” \n\\\u003e When things are going bad, don’t get all bummed out, don’t get startled, don’t get frustrated.

You are not buying stocks; you are buying additional streams of income that do not require your time. \n \n\\## Chapter 3: Understand your Investments\n\\\u003e Only invest in things that can be explained with a quick diagram on the back of an envelope. If you don’t understand it or you don’t believe it, don’t invest in it. That may sound overly simplistic, but I have made millions relying on this rule of thumb as an investor. \n \n\\\u003e My friend Jorge has a great business called American Home Preservation. It’s sort of a feel-good business. You see, Jorge’s business buys failed mortgages from banks. A failed mortgage is when the home owner stops paying it. As you can imagine, there were an awful lot of these in 2008. However, there is no shortage of them now either. Jorge’s company buys these mortgages in bulk at pennies on the dollar from the issuing bank. Then, instead of kicking people out their homes, he negotiates with them and rents the home back to the owner—with an option to buy—at a price they can afford. Because he’s buying the mortgages for pennies on the dollar, the profit margin after renting these homes out is huge. But Jorge doesn’t buy all these mortgages himself; he gets much of it financed through investors. In fact, you can invest as little as a few hundred bucks with Jorge, and he will give you 12% annual return on your investment issued to you as a monthly check. That’s a pretty easy-to-understand model, right? I bet you could easily diagram that out on the back of an envelope. \n \n\\## Chapter 5: Essentials\n\\\u003e My philosophy is to invest money primarily into the first two levels of Maslow’s hierarchy. Why? I believe in primarily investing in things we must have, not the things we desire. No matter how tough times get, people must feed themselves and provide themselves shelter. \n \n\\## Chapter 7: Invest in Financial Education\n\\\u003e In the 1970s, psychologist Noel Burch described the four stages of competence. Here are the steps as I understand them: Level 1: Unconscious incompetence. You don’t know what you don’t know. Level 2: Conscious incompetence. You have insight into your own knowledge deficits and understand your current limitations. Level 3: Conscious competence. You understand and can execute, but it is not second nature.

The ONE Thing\n\\\u003e Curly: Do you know what the secret of life is? Mitch: No. What? Curly: This. He holds up one finger. Mitch: Your finger? Curly: One thing. Just one thing. You stick to that and everything else don’t mean shit. Mitch: That’s great, but what’s the “one thing”? Curly: That’s what you’ve got to figure out. \n \n\\\u003e When you want the absolute best chance to succeed at anything you want, your approach should always be the same. Go small. \n \n\\\u003e Extraordinary results are directly determined by how narrow you can make your focus. \n \n\\### 2. The Domino Effect\n\\\u003e Because extraordinary success is sequential, not simultaneous. What starts out linear becomes geometric. You do the right thing and then you do the next right thing. Over time it adds up, and the geometric potential of success is unleashed. \n \n\\### 3. Success Leaves Clues\n\\\u003e Passion for something leads to disproportionate time practicing or working at it. That time spent eventually translates to skill, and when skill improves, results improve. Better results generally lead to more enjoyment, and more passion and more time is invested. It can be a virtuous cycle all the way to extraordinary results. \n \n\\## Part 1: The Lies \n\\### 4. Everything Matters Equally\n\\\u003e When everything feels urgent and important, everything seems equal. We become active and busy, but this doesn’t actually move us any closer to success. Activity is often unrelated to productivity, and busyness rarely takes care of business. \n \n\\\u003e Knocking out a hundred tasks for whatever the reason is a poor substitute for doing even one task that’s meaningful. Not everything matters equally, and success isn’t a game won by whoever does the most. Yet that is exactly how most play it on a daily basis.\n \n\\\u003e Selected effort creates almost all of the rewards.\n \n\\\u003e Whether you say “later” or “never,” the point is to say “not now” to anything else you could do until your most important work is done. \n \n\\### 5. Multitasking\n\\\u003e Researchers estimate that workers are interrupted every 11 minutes and then spend almost a third of their day recovering from these distractions. \n \n\\\u003e With an average of 4,000 thoughts a day flying in and out of our heads, it’s easy to see why we try to multitask. If a change in thought every 14 seconds is an invitation to change direction, then it’s rather obvious we’re continually tempted to try to do too much at once. While doing one thing we’re only seconds away from thinking of something else we could do. \n \n\\\u003e Chronic multitaskers develop a distorted sense of how long it takes to do things. They almost always believe tasks take longer to complete than is actually required. \n \n\\\u003e Workers who use computers during the day change windows or check e-mail or other programs nearly 37 times an hour. Being in a distractible setting sets us up to be more distractible. Or maybe it’s the high. Media multitaskers actually experience a thrill with switching—a burst of dopamine—that can be addictive. Without it, they can feel bored. For whatever the reason, the results are unambiguous: multitasking slows us down and makes us slower witted. \n \n\\\u003e He found that distracted driving is responsible for 16 percent of all traffic fatalities and nearly half a million injuries annually. Even an idle phone conversation when driving takes a 40 percent bite out of your focus and, surprisingly, can have the same effect as being drunk. \n \n\\### 6. A Disciplined Life\n\\\u003e So when you see people who look like “disciplined” people, what you’re really seeing is people who’ve trained a handful of habits into their lives. This makes them seem “disciplined” when actually they’re not. No one is. \n \n\\### 7. Willpower Is Always on Will-Call\n\\\u003e When our willpower runs out, we all revert to our default settings. This begs the question: What are your default settings? If your willpower is dragging, will you grab the bag of carrots or the bag of chips? Will you be up for focusing on the work at hand or down for any distraction that drops in? When your most important work is done while your willpower wanes, default will define your level of achievement. Average is often the result. \n \n\\### 8. A Balanced Life\n\\\u003e The act of living a full life by giving time to what matters is a balancing act. Extraordinary results require focused attention and time. Time on one thing means time away from another. This makes balance impossible. \n \n\\\u003e The idea of counterbalancing is that you never go so far that you can’t find your way back or stay so long that there is nothing waiting for you when you return. \n \n\\### 9. Big Is Bad\n\\\u003e “The rung of a ladder was never meant to rest upon, but only to hold a man’s foot long enough to enable him to put the other somewhat higher.” Thomas Henry Huxley \n \n\\\u003e That’s when it’s important to realize that on the journey to achieving big, you get bigger. Big requires growth, and by the time you arrive, you’re big too! \n \n\\\u003e Achievement and abundance show up because they’re the natural outcomes of doing the right things with no limits attached. \n \n\\## Part 2: The Truth \n\\### 10. The Focusing Question\n\\\u003e And here is the prime condition of success, the great secret—concentrate your energy, thought and capital exclusively upon the business in which you are engaged. Having begun on one line, resolve to fight it out on that line, to lead in it, adopt every improvement, have the best machinery, and know the most about it. The concerns which fail are those which have scattered their capital, which means that they have scattered their brains also. They have investments in this, or that, or the other, here, there and everywhere. “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket” is all wrong. I tell you “put all your eggs in one basket, and then watch that basket.” Look round you and take notice; men who do that do not often fail. It is easy to watch and carry the one basket. It is trying to carry too many baskets that breaks most eggs in this country. \n \n\\\u003e The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret to getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks and then starting on the first one. \n \n\\\u003e Answers come from questions, and the quality of any answer is directly determined by the quality of the question. \n \n\\\u003e The last two lines deserve repeating: “... any wage I had asked of Life, Life would have willingly paid.” One of the most empowering moments of my life came when I realized that life is a question and how we live it is our answer. How we phrase the questions we ask ourselves determines the answers that eventually become our life. \n \n\\\u003e Anyone who dreams of an uncommon life eventually discovers there is no choice but to seek an uncommon approach to living it. \n \n\\\u003e “What’s the ONE Thing I can do / such that by doing it / everything else will be easier or unnecessary?” \n \n\\\u003e Archimedes said, “Give me a lever long enough and I could move the world,” \n \n\\### 11. The Success Habit\n\\\u003e “Success is simple. Do what’s right, the right way, at the right time.” Arnold H. Glasow \n\\\u003e \n\\### 12. The Path to Great Answers\n\\\u003e “People do not decide their futures, they decide their habits and their habits decide their futures.” F. M. Alexander \n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e Low goals don’t require extraordinary actions so they rarely lead to extraordinary results. \n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e A college professor once told me, “Gary, you’re smart, but people have lived before you. You’re not the first person to dream big, so you’d be wise to study what others have learned first, and then build your actions on the back of their lessons.” \n\\\u003e \n\\## Part 3: Extraordinary Results \n\\### 13. Live with Purpose\n\\\u003e Pick a direction, start marching down that path, and see how you like it. Time brings clarity and if you find you don’t like it, you can always change your mind. It’s your life. \n \n\\### 14. Live by Priority\n\\\u003e Live with purpose and you know where you want to go. Live by priority and you’ll know what to do to get there. \n \n\\### 15. Live for Productivity\n\\\u003e To experience extraordinary results, be a maker in the morning and a manager in the afternoon. \n \n\\### 16. The Three Commitments\n\\\u003e Highly productive people don’t accept the limitations of their natural approach as the final word on their success. When they hit a ceiling of achievement, they look for new models and systems, better ways to do things to push them through. They pause just long enough to examine their options, they pick the best one, and then they’re right back at it. \n \n\\\u003e Accountable people are results oriented and never defend actions, skill levels, models, systems, or relationships that just aren’t getting the job done. They bring their best to whatever it takes, without reservation. \n \n\\### 17. The Four Thieves \n\\\u003e THE FOUR THIEVES OF PRODUCTIVITY \n1\\. Inability to Say “No”\n2\\. Fear of Chaos\n3\\. Poor Health Habits\n4\\. Environment Doesn’t Support Your Goals \n\n\\\u003e Seth Godin says, “You can say no with respect, you can say no promptly, and you can say no with a lead to someone who might say yes. But just saying yes because you can’t bear the short-term pain of saying no is not going to help you do the work.” \n \n\\### 18. The Journey\n\\\u003e One evening an elder Cherokee told his grandson about a battle that goes on inside all people. He said, “My son, the battle is between two wolves inside us. One is Fear. It carries anxiety, concern, uncertainty, hesitancy, indecision and inaction. The other is Faith. It brings calm, conviction, confidence, enthusiasm, decisiveness, excitement and action.” The grandson thought about it for a moment and then meekly asked his grandfather: “Which wolf wins?” The old Cherokee replied, “The one you feed.” \n \n\\\u003e Bronnie Ware’s 2012 book The Top Five Regrets of the Dying \n","method":["Digital"],"rating":"★★★★★","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recUuY5XXKqM6N9Sv"},{"title":"The Stranger","media":"Book","creator":"Albert Camus","length":146,"year":"1942","date":"2017-01-23","date_updated":"2017-01-22","status":"Complete","summary":"\\## \\*\\*Part One\\*\\*\n\\### Chapter 1 \n\\\u003e Maman died today. Or yesterday maybe, I don’t know. \n \n\\### Chapter 6\n\\\u003e That’s when everything began to reel. The sea carried up a thick, fiery breath. It seemed to me as if the sky split open from one end to the other to rain down fire. My whole being tensed and I squeezed my hand around the revolver. The trigger gave; I felt the smooth underside of the butt; and there, in that noise, sharp and deafening at the same time, is where it all started. I shook off the sweat and sun. I knew that I had shattered the harmony of the day, the exceptional silence of a beach where I’d been happy. Then I fired four more times at the motionless body where the bullets lodged without leaving a trace. And it was like knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness. \n \n\\## \\*\\*Part Two\\*\\*\n\\### Chapter 1\n\\\u003e On my way out I was even going to shake his hand, but just in time, I remembered that I had killed a man. \n \n\\### Chapter 2\n\\\u003e I realized then that a man who had lived only one day could easily live for a hundred years in prison. He would have enough memories to keep him from being bored. In a way, it was an advantage. \n\n\\\u003e I hadn’t understood how days could be both long and short at the same time: long to live through, maybe, but so drawn out that they ended up flowing into one another. They lost their names. Only the words “yesterday” and “tomorrow” still had any meaning for me. \n \n\\### Chapter 5\n\\\u003e Deep down I knew perfectly well that it doesn’t much matter whether you die at thirty or at seventy, since in either case other men and women will naturally go on living—and for thousands of years. \n \n\\## Vocabulary\n\n\\- Paraffin - from crude petroleum; used for candles and for preservative or waterproof coatings\n\\- Moorish - a style of architecture common in Spain from the 13th to 16th centuries; characterized by horseshoe-shaped arches\n\\- Tamarisks - any shrub or small tree of the genus \n\\- Promontory - a natural elevation (especially a rocky one that juts out into the sea)\n\\- Trawler - a fisherman who use a trawl net\n\\- Cortege - a funeral procession\n\\- Parricide - someone who kills his or her parent\n\\- Sinewy - especially impossible to ches\n","method":["Digital"],"rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recPTAEBkdMDVxStm"},{"title":"Common Sense: By Thomas Paine","media":"Book","creator":"Thomas Paine","length":69,"year":"1776","date":"2017-01-19","date_updated":"2017-01-09","status":"Complete","summary":"\\## Chapter 2 OF MONARCHY AND HEREDITARY SUCCESSION\n\\\u003e Male and female are the distinctions of nature, good and bad the distinctions of heaven; but how a race of men came into the world so exalted above the rest, and distinguished like some new species, is worth inquiring into, and whether they are the means of happiness or of misery to mankind. \n\n\\## Chapter 1 OF THE ORIGIN AND DESIGN OF GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL, WITH CONCISE REMARKS ON THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION\n\\\u003e Society is produced by our wants, and government by our wickedness; the former promotes our happiness POSITIVELY by uniting our affections, the latter NEGATIVELY by restraining our vices. \n \n\\\u003e …it is the pride of kings which throw mankind into confusion. \n\n\\## Chapter 3 THOUGHTS ON THE PRESENT STATE OF AMERICAN AFFAIRS\n\\\u003e …if they cannot conquer us, they cannot govern us. \n \n\\\u003e Is the power who is jealous of our prosperity, a proper power to govern us? \n\n\\\u003e For as in absolute governments the King is law, so in free countries the law OUGHT to be King; and there ought to be no other.

It lasers in on what you perceive your personal shortcomings and failures to already be, and then emphasizes them for you. You learn about the best ways to make money because you feel you don’t have enough money already. You stand in front of the mirror and repeat affirmations saying that you’re beautiful because you feel as though you’re not beautiful already. You follow dating and relationship advice because you feel that you’re unlovable already. You try goofy visualization exercises about being more successful because you feel as though you aren’t successful enough already. Ironically, this fixation on the positive—on what’s better, what’s superior—only serves to remind us over and over again of what we are not, of what we lack, of what we should have been but failed to be. After all, no truly happy person feels the need to stand in front of a mirror and recite that she’s happy. She just is. \n \n\\### The Feedback Loop from Hell \n\\\u003e We feel bad about feeling bad. We feel guilty for feeling guilty. We get angry about getting angry. We get anxious about feeling anxious. What is wrong with me? This is why not giving a fuck is so key. This is why it’s going to save the world. And it’s going to save it by accepting that the world is totally fucked and that’s all right, because it’s always been that way, and always will be. By not giving a fuck that you feel bad, you short-circuit the Feedback Loop from Hell; you say to yourself, “I feel like shit, but who gives a fuck?” And then, as if sprinkled by magic fuck-giving fairy dust, you stop hating yourself for feeling so bad. \n \n\\\u003e The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience. \n \n\\\u003e “You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.”\n \n\\\u003e Being open with your insecurities paradoxically makes you more confident and charismatic around others. The pain of honest confrontation is what generates the greatest trust and respect in your relationships. Suffering through your fears and anxieties is what allows you to build courage and perseverance.\n \n\\### The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck \n\\\u003e Then, as we grow older and enter middle age, something else begins to change. Our energy level drops. Our identity solidifies. We know who we are and we accept ourselves, including some of the parts we aren’t thrilled about. And, in a strange way, this is liberating. We no longer need to give a fuck about everything. Life is just what it is. We accept it, warts and all. We realize that we’re never going to cure cancer or go to the moon or feel Jennifer Aniston’s tits. And that’s okay. Life goes on. We now reserve our ever-dwindling fucks for the most truly fuck-worthy parts of our lives: our families, our best friends, our golf swing. And, to our astonishment, this is enough. This simplification actually makes us really fucking happy on a consistent basis. \n \n\\### So Mark, What the Fuck Is the Point of This Book Anyway? \n\\\u003e The idea of not giving a fuck is a simple way of reorienting our expectations for life and choosing what is important and what is not. Developing this ability leads to something I like to think of as a kind of “practical enlightenment.” \n \n\\### Happiness Comes from Solving Problems \n\\\u003e Happiness comes from solving problems. The keyword here is “solving.” If you’re avoiding your problems or feel like you don’t have any problems, then you’re going to make yourself miserable. If you feel like you have problems that you can’t solve, you will likewise make yourself miserable. \n \n\\### Emotions Are Overrated \n\\\u003e Emotions are simply biological signals designed to nudge you in the direction of beneficial change. \n \n\\\u003e In other words, negative emotions are a call to action. When you feel them, it’s because you’re supposed to do something. \n \n\\### Choose Your Struggle \n\\\u003e What determines your success isn’t, “What do you want to enjoy?” The relevant question is, “What pain do you want to sustain?” The path to happiness is a path full of shitheaps and shame. \n \n\\\u003e Decision-making based on emotional intuition, without the aid of reason to keep it in line, pretty much always sucks. You know who bases their entire lives on their emotions? Three-year-old kids. And dogs. You know what else three-year-olds and dogs do? Shit on the carpet. \n \n\\\u003e I wanted the reward and not the struggle. I wanted the result and not the process. I was in love with not the fight but only the victory. And life doesn’t work that way. \n \n\\### Things Fall Apart \n\\\u003e The deeper the pain, the more helpless we feel against our problems, and the more entitlement we adopt to compensate for those problems. This entitlement plays out in one of two ways: 1. I’m awesome and the rest of you all suck, so I deserve special treatment. 2. I suck and the rest of you are all awesome, so I deserve special treatment. \n \n\\### B-b-b-but, If I’m Not Going to Be Special or Extraordinary, What’s the Point? \n\\\u003e The rare people who do become truly exceptional at something do so not because they believe they’re exceptional. On the contrary, they become amazing because they’re obsessed with improvement. And that obsession with improvement stems from an unerring belief that they are, in fact, not that great at all. \n \n\\\u003e People who become great at something become great because they understand that they’re not already great—they are mediocre, they are average—and that they could be so much better. \n \n\\### The Self-Awareness Onion \n\\\u003e Take a moment and think of something that’s really bugging you. Now ask yourself why it bugs you. Chances are the answer will involve a failure of some sort. Then take that failure and ask why it seems “true” to you. What if that failure wasn’t really a failure? What if you’ve been looking at it the wrong way? \n \n\\### Rock Star Problems \n\\\u003e Our values determine the metrics by which we measure ourselves and everyone else. \n \n\\\u003e If you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and/ or how you measure failure/ success. \n \n\\### Shitty Values \n\\\u003e Pleasure is the most superficial form of life satisfaction and therefore the easiest to obtain and the easiest to lose. \n \n\\\u003e When people measure themselves not by their behavior, but by the status symbols they’re able to collect, then not only are they shallow, but they’re probably assholes as well. \n \n\\\u003e Remember, emotions are just feedback.\n \n\\### Defining Good and Bad Values \n\\\u003e When we have poor values—that is, poor standards we set for ourselves and others—we are essentially giving fucks about the things that don’t matter, things that in fact make our life worse. But when we choose better values, we are able to divert our fucks to something better—toward things that matter, things that improve the state of our well-being and that generate happiness, pleasure, and success as side effects.\n \n\\## Chapter 5: You Are Always Choosing\n\\\u003eBut when you chose it freely and prepared for it, it was a glorious and important milestone in your life. When it was forced upon you against your will, it was one of the most terrifying and painful experiences of your life. Often the only difference between a problem being painful or being powerful is a sense that we chose it, and that we are responsible for it. \n \n\\\u003e When we feel that we’re choosing our problems, we feel empowered. When we feel that our problems are being forced upon us against our will, we feel victimized and miserable. \n \n\\### The Choice \n\\\u003e But one night, while reading lectures by the philosopher Charles Peirce, James decided to conduct a little experiment. In his diary, he wrote that he would spend one year believing that he was 100 percent responsible for everything that occurred in his life, no matter what. During this period, he would do everything in his power to change his circumstances, no matter the likelihood of failure. If nothing improved in that year, then it would be apparent that he was truly powerless to the circumstances around him, and then he would take his own life. \n \n\\\u003e Whether we consciously recognize it or not, we are always responsible for our experiences. It’s impossible not to be. Choosing to not consciously interpret events in our lives is still an interpretation of the events of our lives. Choosing to not respond to the events in our lives is still a response to the events in our lives. \n \n\\\u003e To not give a fuck about anything is still to give a fuck about something. \n \n\\### The Responsibility/Fault Fallacy \n\\\u003e Fault is past tense. Responsibility is present tense. Fault results from choices that have already been made. Responsibility results from the choices you’re currently making, every second of every day. \n \n\\### Victimhood Chic \n\\\u003e The responsibility/ fault fallacy allows people to pass off the responsibility for solving their problems to others. This ability to alleviate responsibility through blame gives people a temporary high and a feeling of moral righteousness. \n \n\\### There Is No “How” \n\\\u003e You are already choosing, in every moment of every day, what to give a fuck about, so change is as simple as choosing to give a fuck about something else. \n \n\\### Manson’s Law of Avoidance \n\\\u003e This is why people are often so afraid of success—for the exact same reason they’re afraid of failure: it threatens who they believe themselves to be. \n \n\\### Kill Yourself \n\\\u003e Buddhism argues that your idea of who “you” are is an arbitrary mental construction and that you should let go of the idea that “you” exist at all; that the arbitrary metrics by which you define yourself actually trap you, and thus you’re better off letting go of everything. In a sense, you could say that Buddhism encourages you to not give a fuck. \n \n\\\u003e I have both some good news and some bad news for you: there is little that is unique or special about your problems. That’s why letting go is so liberating. There’s a kind of self-absorption that comes with fear based on an irrational certainty. When you assume that your plane is the one that’s going to crash, or that your project idea is the stupid one everyone is going to laugh at, or that you’re the one everyone is going to choose to mock or ignore, you’re implicitly telling yourself, “I’m the exception; I’m unlike everybody else; I’m different and special.” This is narcissism, pure and simple. You feel as though your problems deserve to be treated differently, that your problems have some unique math to them that doesn’t obey the laws of the physical universe. My recommendation: don’t be special; don’t be unique. Redefine your metrics in mundane and broad ways. Choose to measure yourself not as a rising star or an undiscovered genius. Choose to measure yourself not as some horrible victim or dismal failure. Instead, measure yourself by more mundane identities: a student, a partner, a friend, a creator. The narrower and rarer the identity you choose for yourself, the more everything will seem to threaten you. For that reason, define yourself in the simplest and most ordinary ways possible. This often means giving up some grandiose ideas about yourself: that you’re uniquely intelligent, or spectacularly talented, or intimidatingly attractive, or especially victimized in ways other people could never imagine. This means giving up your sense of entitlement and your belief that you’re somehow owed something by this world. This means giving up the supply of emotional highs that you’ve been sustaining yourself on for years. Like a junkie giving up the needle, you’re going to go through withdrawal when you start giving these things up. But you’ll come out the other side so much better. \n \n\\### The Failure/Success Paradox \n\\\u003e If someone is better than you at something, then it’s likely because she has failed at it more than you have. If someone is worse than you, it’s likely because he hasn’t been through all of the painful learning experiences you have. \n \n\\\u003e At some point, most of us reach a place where we’re afraid to fail, where we instinctively avoid failure and stick only to what is placed in front of us or only what we’re already good at. \n \n\\### Pain Is Part of the Process \n\\\u003e Dabrowski argued that fear and anxiety and sadness are not necessarily always undesirable or unhelpful states of mind; rather, they are often representative of the necessary pain of psychological growth. And to deny that pain is to deny our own potential. \n \n\\\u003e VCR questions are funny because the answer appears difficult to anyone who has them and appears easy to anyone who does not. \n \n\\\u003e Learn to sustain the pain you’ve chosen. When you choose a new value, you are choosing to introduce a new form of pain into your life. Relish it. Savor it. Welcome it with open arms. Then act despite it. \n \n\\## Chapter 8: The Importance of Saying No\n\\\u003e Because after all the years of excitement, the biggest lesson I took from my adventuring was this: absolute freedom, by itself, means nothing. \n \n\\\u003e Travel is a fantastic self-development tool, because it extricates you from the values of your culture and shows you that another society can live with entirely different values and still function and not hate themselves. This exposure to different cultural values and metrics then forces you to reexamine what seems obvious in your own life and to consider that perhaps it’s not necessarily the best way to live. \n \n\\### Boundaries \n\\\u003e Romeo and Juliet is synonymous with “romance” in our culture today. It is seen as the love story in English-speaking culture, an emotional ideal to live up to. Yet when you really get down to what happens in the story, these kids are absolutely out of their fucking minds. And they just killed themselves to prove it! \n \n\\\u003e The difference between a healthy and an unhealthy relationship comes down to two things: 1) how well each person in the relationship accepts responsibility, and 2) the willingness of each person to both reject and be rejected by their partner. \n \n\\\u003e Wherever there is a healthy and loving relationship, there will be clear boundaries between the two people and their values, and there will be an open avenue of giving and receiving rejection when necessary. \n \n\\\u003e People can’t solve your problems for you. And they shouldn’t try, because that won’t make you happy. You can’t solve other people’s problems for them either, because that likewise won’t make them happy. \n \n\\### The Sunny Side of Death \n\\\u003e Our culture today confuses great attention and great success, assuming them to be the same thing. But they are not. \n \n\\\u003e You are already great because in the face of endless confusion and certain death, you continue to choose what to give a fuck about and what not to. This mere fact, this simple optioning for your own values in life, already makes you beautiful, already makes you successful, and already makes you loved. Even if you don’t realize it. Even if you’re sleeping in a gutter and starving. \n \n\\## Vocabulary\n\n\\- Whirring - make a low, continuous, regular sound\n\\- Veritable - used as an intensifier, often to qualify a metaphor\n\n","method":["Digital"],"rating":"★★★★★","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recBmRAyxLh8liGhT"},{"title":"Sherlock","media":"TV","date":"2017-01-01","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","season":"Season 4","rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:33:35.000Z","id":"rech7GHQIKVsVTN3g"},{"title":"The Leftovers","media":"TV","date":"2017-01-01","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","season":"Season 3","rating":"★★★☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:33:35.000Z","id":"rechPUzwepwFHmXLU"},{"title":"My Brother, My Brother, and Me","media":"TV","date":"2017-01-01","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","season":"Season 1","rating":"★★★★★","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:33:35.000Z","id":"recjS6TkYzkdlJmyP"},{"title":"Planet Earth II","media":"TV","date":"2017-01-01","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","season":"Season 2","rating":"★★★★★","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:33:35.000Z","id":"recOmiDIbSI6nACeI"},{"title":"Master of None","media":"TV","date":"2017-01-01","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","season":"Season 2","rating":"★★☆☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:33:35.000Z","id":"recP55zTwnbwbLJg1"},{"title":"Coach: Lessons on the Game of Life","media":"Audiobook","creator":"Michael   Lewis","length":96,"year":"2005","date":"2016-11-23","date_updated":"2016-11-23","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","method":["Audiobook"],"isbn":"0393060918","isbn13":9780393060911,"rating":"★★★☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recwtlQmQY6FMCmrK"},{"title":"In the Plex: How Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our Lives","media":"Audiobook","creator":"Steven Levy","length":432,"year":"2011","date":"2016-11-15","date_updated":"2016-11-17","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","method":["Audiobook"],"isbn":"1416596585","isbn13":9781416596585,"rating":"★★★☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recX8jNUrC8ctblYq"},{"title":"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind","media":"Audiobook","creator":"Yuval Noah Harari","length":498,"year":"2011","date":"2016-11-07","date_updated":"2016-06-28","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","method":["Audiobook"],"rating":"★★★★★","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recZdP0pBWfcmYEjl"},{"title":"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies","media":"Book","creator":"Nick Bostrom","length":352,"year":"2014","date":"2016-11-01","date_updated":"2016-08-17","status":"Complete","summary":"\\## Great expectations \n\\\u003e Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an “intelligence explosion,” and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control. \n \n\\## Seasons of hope and despair \n\\\u003e Accordingly, one can view artificial intelligence as a quest to find shortcuts: ways of tractably approximating the Bayesian ideal by sacrificing some optimality or generality while preserving enough to get high performance in the actual domains of interest. \n \n\\\u003e Metaphorically, we can think of a probability as sand on a large sheet of paper. The paper is partitioned into areas of various sizes, each area corresponding to one possible world, with larger areas corresponding to simpler possible worlds. Imagine also a layer of sand of even thickness spread across the entire sheet: this is our prior probability distribution. Whenever an observation is made that rules out some possible worlds, we remove the sand from the corresponding areas of the paper and redistribute it evenly over the areas that remain in play. Thus, the total amount of sand on the sheet never changes, it just gets concentrated into fewer areas as observational evidence accumulates. This is a picture of learning in its purest form. \n \n\\## State of the art \n\\\u003e One sympathizes with John McCarthy, who lamented: “As soon as it works, no one calls it AI anymore.” \n \n\\\u003e The computer scientist Donald Knuth was struck that “AI has by now succeeded in doing essentially everything that requires ‘thinking’ but has failed to do most of what people and animals do ‘without thinking’—that, somehow, is much harder!” Analyzing visual scenes, recognizing objects, or controlling a robot’s behavior as it interacts with a natural environment has proved challenging. Nevertheless, a fair amount of progress has been made and continues to be made, aided by steady improvements in hardware. \n \n\\\u003e Now, it must be stressed that the demarcation between artificial intelligence and software in general is not sharp. Some of the applications listed above might be viewed more as generic software applications than as AI in particular—though this brings us back to McCarthy’s dictum that when something works it is no longer called AI. \n \n\\\u003e The algorithm just does what it does; and unless it is a very special kind of algorithm, it does not care that we clasp our heads and gasp in dumbstruck horror at the absurd inappropriateness of its actions. \n \n\\## Opinions about the future of machine intelligence \n\\\u003e For example, Nils Nilsson has spent a long and productive career working on problems in search, planning, knowledge representation, and robotics; he has authored textbooks in artificial intelligence; and he recently completed the most comprehensive history of the field written to date. When asked about arrival dates for HLMI(“human-level machine intelligence”), he offered the following opinion: 80 10% chance: 2030 50% chance: 2050 90% chance: 2100 \n \n\\## Vocabulary\n\n\\- Lacuna - an unfilled space or interval; a gap.\n","method":["Digital"],"rating":"★★★★★","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recJKtshXBx5egLEh"},{"title":"Turning Pro","media":"Book","creator":"Steven Pressfield","length":148,"year":"2012","date":"2016-10-28","date_updated":"2016-10-20","status":"Complete","summary":"\\## My Life As An Amateur \n\\\u003e Ambition, I have come to believe, is the most primal and sacred fundament of our being. To feel ambition and to act upon it is to embrace the unique calling of our souls. Not to act upon that ambition is to turn our backs on ourselves and on the reason for our existence. \n\n\\## Habits \n\\\u003e The difference between an amateur and a professional is in their habits. An amateur has amateur habits. A professional has professional habits.\n \n\\## Art And Addiction \n\\\u003e The amateur is an egotist. He takes the material of his personal pain and uses it to draw attention to himself. He creates a \"life,\" a \"character,\" a \"personality.\" The artist and the professional, on the other hand, have turned a corner in their minds. They have succeeded in stepping back from themselves. They have grown so bored with themselves and so sick of their petty bullshit that they can manipulate those elements the way a HazMat technician handles weapons-grade plutonium.\n \n\\## Pulling The Pin, Part Two \n\\\u003e You and I, who are artists and entrepreneurs, live a life that's closer to natural, if you ask me. We migrate, too. We follow the Muse instead of the sun. When one crop is picked, we hit the road and move on to the next. It's not a bad life. It's lonely. It's tough. It ain't for everyone. But, like the life of a migrant on the road, it has its compensations. \n \n\\## The Definition Of Boring \n\\\u003e Something that's boring goes nowhere. It travels in a circle. It never arrives at its destination. \n \n\\## Addicted To Failure \n\\\u003e There's a glamour to failure that has been mined for centuries by starving poets, romantic suicides, and other self-defined doomed souls. This glamour inverts failure and turns it into \"success.\" \n \n\\## Addicted To Sex \n\\\u003e \"I don't see what all the fuss about sex is,\" said the comedian. \"It's only friction.\" \n \n\\## My Year Of Turning Pro \n\\\u003e I read all the stuff that you're supposed to read in college but never do, or if you do, you're not paying attention. I read Tolstoy and Dostoevsky and Turgenev. I read Cervantes and Flaubert and Stendhal and Knut Hamsun, and I read every American except Faulkner.\n\n\\## A Definition Of The Amateur \n\\\u003e The amateur is young and dumb. He's innocent, he's good-hearted, he's well-intentioned. The amateur is brave. He's inventive and resourceful. He's willing to take a chance. Like Luke Skywalker, the amateur harbors noble aspirations. He has dreams. He seeks liberation and enlightenment. And he's willing, he hopes, to pay the price. The amateur is not evil or crazy. He's not deluded. He's not demented. The amateur is trying to learn. The amateur is you and me. What exactly is an amateur? How does an amateur view himself and the world? What qualities characterize the amateur?\n \n\\## The Amateur Is Terrified \n\\\u003e The amateur fears that if he turns pro and lives out his calling, he will have to live up to who he really is and what he is truly capable of. \n\n\\## The Amateur Lives By The Opinions Of Others \n\\\u003e Though the amateur's identity is seated in his own ego, that ego is so weak that it cannot define itself based on its own self-evaluation. The amateur allows his worth and identity to be defined by others. The amateur craves third-party validation. The amateur is tyrannized by his imagined conception of what is expected of him. He is imprisoned by what he believes he ought to think, how he ought to look, what he ought to do, and who he ought to be. \n \n\\## The Amateur Seeks Permission \n\\\u003e The amateur believes that, before she can act, she must receive permission from some Omnipotent Other —a lover or spouse, a parent, a boss, a figure of authority. \n \n\\## How Your Day Changes When You Turn Pro \n\\\u003e We now structure our hours not to flee from fear, but to confront it and overcome it. We plan our activities in order to accomplish an aim. \n\n\\## A Professional Is Courageous \n\\\u003e The linebacker and the Army Ranger go into action as part of a team. But the artist and the entrepreneur enter combat alone. I take my hat off to every man or woman who does this. \n \n\\## The Professional Does Not Give His Power Away To Others \n\\\u003e When we make someone into an icon, we give away our power. We say to ourselves (unconsciously), \"This person possesses a quality I wish I possessed. Therefore I will worship this person in the hope that that quality will wear off on me, or I will acquire that quality by virtue of my proximity to this mentor/ sensei/ lover/ teacher/ hero.\" \n \n\\\u003e The amateur is an acolyte, a groupie. The professional may seek instruction or wisdom from one who is further along in mastery than he, but he does so without surrendering his self-sovereignty.\n \n\\## A Marine Gets Two Salaries \n\\\u003e When we do the work for itself alone, our pursuit of a career (or a living or fame or wealth or notoriety) turns into something else, something loftier and nobler, which we may never even have thought about or aspired to at the beginning. It turns into a practice. \n\\\u003e \n\\## The Professional Trusts The Mystery \n\\\u003e She asks her students to imagine a small white box. Imagine a lid on this box. Now lift the lid. What do you find inside? Sometimes students say a diamond. Sometimes a frog. Sometimes a pomegranate. The trick is, there is always something inside the box. \n \n\\## Take What The Defense Gives You \n\\\u003e Two key tenets for days when Resistance is really strong: 1. Take what you can get and stay patient. The defense may crack late in the game. 2. Play for tomorrow. Our role on tough-nut days is to maintain our composure and keep chipping away. We're pros. We're not amateurs. We have patience. We can handle adversity. Tomorrow the defense will give us more, and tomorrow we'll take it. There's a third tenet that underlies the first two: 3. We're in this for the long haul. Our work is a practice. One bad day is nothing to us. Ten bad days are nothing. \n \n\\## A Model Of The Universe \n\\\u003e \"There is a second self inside you —an inner, shadow Self. This self doesn't care about you. It doesn't love you. It has its own agenda, and it will kill you. It will kill you like cancer. It will kill you to achieve its agenda, which is to prevent you from actualizing your Self, from becoming who you really are. This shadow self is called, in the Kabbalistic lexicon, the yetzer hara. The yetzer hara, Steve, is what you would call Resistance.\"\n \n\\## Who Is All This For? \n\\\u003e I will gladly shell out $24.95 or $9.99 or 99 cents on iTunes to read or see or listen to the 24-karat treasure that you have refined from your pain and your vision and your imagination. I need it. We all do. We're struggling here in the trenches. That beauty, that wisdom, those thrills and chills, even that mindless escape on a rainy October afternoon —I want it. Put me down for it. The hero wanders. The hero suffers. The hero returns. You are that hero. \n \n\\## Vocabulary\n\n\\- Monomania - exaggerated or obsessive enthusiasm for or preoccupation with one thing.\n\\- Surfeit - an excessive amount of something\n\\- Gnostics - relating to knowledge, especially esoteric mystical knowledge.\n\\- Dint - an impression or hollow in a surface\n\\- Proffer - hold out (something) to someone for acceptance; offer\n\\- Anathema - something or someone that one vehemently dislikes\n\\- Neophyte - a person who is new to a subject, skill, or belief\n\n","method":["Digital"],"rating":"★★★☆☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recGpo29veHzClAiQ"},{"title":"Straight to Hell: True Tales of Deviance, Debauchery, and Billion-Dollar Deals","media":"Book","creator":"John LeFevre","length":288,"year":"2014","date":"2016-10-27","date_updated":"2016-10-14","status":"Complete","summary":"\\## A Felonious Mentality\n\\\u003e He was born on third base and scored on a wild pitch, but at least he can convince his friends (and himself) that he hit a triple and stole home.

Truly, many times have you heard me say that the rewards are great if one succeeds but the rewards are great only because so few succeed. Many succumb to despair and fail without realizing that they already possess all the tools needed to acquire great wealth. Many others face each obstacle in their path with fear and doubt and consider them as enemies when, in truth, these obstructions are friends and helpers. Obstacles are necessary for success because in selling, as in all careers of importance, victory comes only after many struggles and countless defeats. Yet each struggle, each defeat, sharpens your skills and strengths, your courage and your endurance, your ability and your confidence and thus each obstacle is a comrade-in-arms forcing you to become better … or quit. Each rebuff is an opportunity to move forward; turn away from them, avoid them, and you throw away your future.” \n \n\\\u003e Never feel shame for trying and failing for he who has never failed is he who has never tried. \n \n\\## Chapter Seven\n\\\u003e The bird leaped into his palm. “Thousands of your kind are outside and afraid. But you had the courage to come through the window.” \n \n\\## Chapter Eight\n\\\u003e The career I have chosen is laden with opportunity yet it is fraught with heartbreak and despair and the bodies of those who have failed, were they piled one atop another, would cast a shadow down upon all the pyramids of the earth. \n \n\\\u003e Failure no longer will be my payment for struggle. Just as nature made no provision for my body to tolerate pain neither has it made any provision for my life to suffer failure. Failure, like pain, is alien to my life. In the past I accepted it as I accepted pain. Now I reject it and I am prepared for wisdom and principles which will guide me out of the shadows into the sunlight of wealth, position, and happiness far beyond my most extravagant dreams until even the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides will seem no more than my just reward. \n \n\\\u003e I have lived as an onion plant. It has not pleased me. \n \n\\\u003e The value of experience is overrated, usually by old men who nod wisely and speak stupidly. \n \n\\\u003e Furthermore, experience is comparable to fashion; an action that proved successful today will be unworkable and impractical tomorrow. \n \n\\\u003e Good habits are the key to all success. Bad habits are the unlocked door to failure. Thus, the first law I will obey, which precedeth all others is—I will form good habits and become their slave. \n \n\\\u003e My actions are ruled by appetite, passion, prejudice, greed, love, fear, environment, habit, and the worst of these tyrants is habit. \n \n\\\u003e Therefore, if I must be a slave to habit let me be a slave to good habits. My bad habits must be destroyed and new furrows prepared for good seed. I will form good habits and become their slave. \n \n\\\u003e And what will be accomplished with this habit? Herein lies the hidden secret of all man’s accomplishments. As I repeat the words daily they will soon become a part of my active mind, but more important, they will also seep into my other mind, that mysterious source which never sleeps, which creates my dreams, and often makes me act in ways I do not comprehend. As the words of these scrolls are consumed by my mysterious mind I will begin to awake, each morning, with a vitality I have never known before. My vigor will increase, my enthusiasm will rise, my desire to meet the world will overcome every fear I once knew at sunrise, and I will be happier than I ever believed it possible to be in this world of strife and sorrow. \n \n\\## Chapter Nine\n\\\u003e My reasoning they may counter; my speech they may distrust; my apparel they may disapprove; my face they may reject; and even my bargains may cause them suspicion; yet my love will melt all hearts liken to the sun whose rays soften the coldest clay. \n \n\\\u003e I will greet this day with love in my heart. And how will I do this? Henceforth will I look on all things with love and I will be born again. I will love the sun for it warms my bones; yet I will love the rain for it cleanses my spirit. I will love the light for it shows me the way; yet I will love the darkness for it shows me the stars. I will welcome happiness for it enlarges my heart; yet I will endure sadness for it opens my soul. I will acknowledge rewards for they are my due; yet I will welcome obstacles for they are my challenge. \n \n\\\u003e I will greet this day with love in my heart. And how will I speak? I will laud mine enemies and they will become friends; I will encourage my friends and they will become brothers. Always will I dig for reasons to applaud; never will I scratch for excuses to gossip. When I am tempted to criticize I will bite on my tongue; when I am moved to praise I will shout from the roofs. \n \n\\\u003e I will greet this day with love in my heart. And how will I act? I will love all manners of men for each has qualities to be admired even though they be hidden. With love I will tear down the wall of suspicion and hate which they have built round their hearts and in its place will I build bridges so that my love may enter their souls. \n \n\\\u003e I will love the ambitious for they can inspire me! I will love the failures for they can teach me. I will love the kings for they are but human; I will love the meek for they are divine. I will love the rich for they are yet lonely; I will love the poor for they are so many. I will love the young for the faith they hold; I will love the old for the wisdom they share. I will love the beautiful for their eyes of sadness; I will love the ugly for their souls of peace. \n \n\\\u003e I will greet this day with love in my heart. But how will I react to the actions of others? With love. For just as love is my weapon to open the hearts of men, love is also my shield to repulse the arrows of hate and the spears of anger. Adversity and discouragement will beat against my new shield and become as the softest of rains. My shield will protect me in the market place and sustain me when I am alone. It will uplift me in moments of despair yet it will calm me in time of exultation. It will become stronger and more protective with use until one day I will cast it aside and walk unencumbered among all manners of men and, when I do, my name will be raised high on the pyramid of life. \n \n\\\u003e I will greet this day with love in my heart. And how will I confront each whom I meet? In only one way. In silence and to myself I will address him and say I Love You. Though spoken in silence these words will shine in my eyes, unwrinkle my brow, bring a smile to my lips, and echo in my voice; and his heart will be opened. And who is there who will say nay to my goods when his heart feels my love? \n \n\\\u003e I will greet this day with love in my heart. And most of all I will love myself. For when I do I will zealously inspect all things which enter my body, my mind, my soul, and my heart. Never will I overindulge the requests of my flesh, rather I will cherish my body with cleanliness and moderation. Never will I allow my mind to be attracted to evil and despair, rather I will uplift it with the knowledge and wisdom of the ages. Never will I allow my soul to become complacent and satisfied, rather I will feed it with meditation and prayer. Never will I allow my heart to become small and bitter, rather I will share it and it will grow and warm the earth. \n\\\u003e \n\\\u003e I will greet this day with love in my heart. Henceforth will I love all mankind. From this moment all hate is let from my veins for I have not time to hate, only time to love. From this moment I take the first step required to become a man among men. With love I will increase my sales a hundredfold and become a great salesman. If I have no other qualities I can succeed with love alone. Without it I will fail though I possess all the knowledge and skills of the world. I will greet this day with love, and I will succeed. \n \n\\\u003e Always will I take another step. If that is of no avail I will take another, and yet another. \n \n\\## Chapter Ten\n\\\u003e I will persist until I succeed. I was not delivered unto this world in defeat, nor does failure course in my veins. I am not a sheep waiting to be prodded by my shepherd. I am a lion and I refuse to talk, to walk, to sleep with the sheep. I will hear not those who weep and complain, for their disease is contagious. Let them join the sheep. The slaughterhouse of failure is not my destiny. \n \n\\\u003e I will never consider defeat and I will remove from my vocabulary such words and phrases as quit, cannot, unable, impossible, out of the question, improbable, failure, unworkable, hopeless, and retreat; for they are the words of fools. \n \n\\## Chapter Eleven\n\\\u003e I am nature’s greatest miracle. Since the beginning of time never has there been another with my mind, my heart, my eyes, my ears, my hands, my hair, my mouth. None that came before, none that live today, and none that come tomorrow can walk and talk and move and think exactly like me. All men are my brothers yet I am different from each. I am a unique creature. \n \n\\\u003e Nevermore will I be satisfied with yesterday’s accomplishments nor will I indulge, anymore, in self-praise for deeds which in reality are too small to even acknowledge. \n \n\\\u003e I am here for a purpose and that purpose is to grow into a mountain, not to shrink to a grain of sand. \n \n\\## Chapter Twelve\n\\\u003e Can sand flow upward in the hour glass? Will the sun rise where it sets and set where it rises? Can I relive the errors of yesterday and right them? Can I call back yesterday’s wounds and make them whole? Can I become younger than yesterday? Can I take back the evil that was spoken, the blows that were struck, the pain that was caused? No. Yesterday is buried forever and I will think of it no more. \n \n\\\u003e What price dare I place on the hours ahead? I will make them priceless! \n \n\\\u003e I will live this day as if it is my last. And if it is not, I shall fall to my knees and give thanks. \n \n\\## Chapter Thirteen\n\\\u003e All nature is a circle of moods and I am a part of nature and so, like the tides, my moods will rise; my moods will fall. \n \n\\\u003e I will learn this secret of the ages: Weak is he who permits his thoughts to control his actions; strong is he who forces his actions to control his thoughts. \n \n\\## Chapter Fourteen\n\\\u003e When I am heavy with heartache I shall console myself that this too shall pass; when I am puffed with success I shall warn myself that this too shall pass. When I am strangled in poverty I shall tell myself that this too shall pass; when I am burdened with wealth I shall tell myself that this too shall pass. \n \n\\## Chapter Fifteen\n To surpass the deeds of others is unimportant; to surpass my own deeds is all. \n \n\\## Chapter Seventeen\n\\\u003e Only for guidance will I pray, that I may be shown the way to acquire these things, and my prayer will always be answered. \n","method":["Digital"],"isbn":"055327757X","isbn13":9780553277579,"rating":"★★★★★","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"reckvCEBhTRSl2tPU"},{"title":"Shoe Dog","media":"Book","creator":"Phil Knight","length":402,"year":"2016","date":"2016-08-29","date_updated":"2016-08-29","status":"Complete","summary":"\\## Part One \n\\### 1962\n\\\u003e In every religion, it seemed, self is the obstacle, the enemy.

To study the self, said the thirteenth-century Zen master Dogen, is to forget the self. Inner voice, outer voices, it’s all the same. No dividing lines. \n \n\\### 1965\n\\\u003e Again and again I learned that lack of equity was a leading cause of failure.\n \n\\### 1966 \n\\\u003e Don’t tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results. \n \n\\\u003e But my hope was that when I failed, if I failed, I’d fail quickly, so I’d have enough time, enough years, to implement all the hard-won lessons. \n \n\\### 1967 \n\\\u003e And then Adidas threatened to sue. Adidas already had a new shoe named the “Azteca Gold,” a track spike they were planning to introduce at the same Olympics. No one had ever heard of it, but that didn’t stop Adidas from kicking up a fuss. \n \n\\\u003e “Who was that guy who kicked the shit out of the Aztecs?” he asked. “Cortez,” I said. He grunted. “Okay. Let’s call it the Cortez.” \n \n\\### 1968 \n\\\u003e Primary principle of all accounting: Assets equal liabilities plus equity. \n \n\\### 1971 \n\\\u003e Shoe dogs were people who devoted themselves wholly to the making, selling, buying, or designing of shoes. \n \n\\### 1973 \n\\\u003e He had a superb talent for underplaying the bad, and underplaying the good, for simply being in the moment. \n \n\\## Part Two \n\\### 1977 \n\\\u003e That’s what men do when they fight. They put up walls. They pull up the drawbridge. They fill in the moat. \n \n\\### 1980 \n\\\u003e When you make something, when you improve something, when you deliver something, when you add some new thing or service to the lives of strangers, making them happier, or healthier, or safer, or better, and when you do it all crisply and efficiently, smartly, the way everything should be done but so seldom is—you’re participating more fully in the whole grand human drama. More than simply alive, you’re helping others to live more fully, and if that’s business, all right, call me a businessman. \n \n\\### Night \n\\\u003e I thought of that phrase, “It’s just business.” It’s never just business. It never will be. If it ever does become just business, that will mean that business is very bad. \n \n\\## Vocabulary\n\n\\- Sinewy - consisting of or resembling sinews\n\\- Slaking - quench or satisfy (one's thirst)\n\\- Trattorias - an Italian restaurant serving simple food\n\\- Languorous - the state or feeling, often pleasant, of tiredness or inertia\n\\- Podiatry - the treatment of the feet and their ailments\n\\- Noisome - having an extremely offensive smell\n\\- Avuncular - of or relating to an uncle; kind and friendly toward a younger or less experienced person\n\\- Internecine - destructive to both sides in a conflict\n\\- Fealty - a feudal tenant's or vassal's sworn loyalty to a lord\n\\- Quotidian - of or occurring every day; daily\n\\- Pagoda - a Hindu or Buddhist temple or sacred building, typically a many-tiered tower, in India and East Asia.\n\\- Suffused - gradually spread through or over\n\\- Carapace - the hard upper shell of a turtle, crustacean, or arachnid.\n\\- Vaunted - boast about or praise (something), especially excessively\n\\- Quixotic - exceedingly idealistic; unrealistic and impractical\n\\- Machinations - engage in plots and intrigues; scheme\n\\- Vehement - showing strong feeling; forceful, passionate, or intense\n\\- Portentous - done in a pompously or overly solemn manner so as to impress\n\\- Wantonly - (of a cruel or violent action) deliberate and unprovoked\n\\- Stolid - (of a person) calm, dependable, and showing little emotion or animation.\n\\- Amanuensis - a literary or artistic assistant, in particular one who takes dictation or copies manuscripts.\n\\- Guile - sly or cunning intelligence\n\\- Beguiled - charm or enchant (someone), sometimes in a deceptive way\n\\- Quell - put an end to (a rebellion or other disorder), typically by the use of force\n\\- Debentures - an unsecured loan certificate issued by a company, backed by general credit rather than by specified assets.\n\\- Paradigmatic - of the nature of a paradigm or model\n\\- Denouement - the final part of a play, movie, or narrative in which the strands of the plot are drawn together and matters are explained or resolved\n\\- Fetid - smelling extremely unpleasant\n\\- Subterfuge - deceit used in order to achieve one's goal\n\\- Gabardine - a smooth, durable twill-woven cloth, typically of worsted or cotton\n\\- Ginkgo - a deciduous Chinese tree related to the conifers, with fan-shaped leaves and yellow flowers\n\\- Castigating - reprimand (someone) severely\n\\- Mohair - the long, silky hair of the angora goat\n\\- Genuflecting - lower one's body briefly by bending one knee to the ground, typically in worship or as a sign of respect\n\\- Guffaw - a loud and boisterous laugh\n\\- Fusillade - a series of shots fired or missiles thrown all at the same time or in quick succession\n\\- Bacchanal - an occasion of wild and drunken revelry\n\\- Coterie - a small group of people with shared interests or tastes, especially one that is exclusive of other people\n\\- Opulence - great wealth or luxuriousness\n\\- Feted - a celebration or festival\n\\- Bulwark - a defensive wall\n","method":["Digital"],"rating":"★★★★★","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recr46NVn03kgQ6Dv"},{"title":"11/22/63","media":"Audiobook","creator":"Stephen King","length":849,"year":"2011","date":"2016-08-29","date_updated":"2015-09-30","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","method":["Audiobook"],"isbn":"1451627289","isbn13":9781451627282,"rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recPqDumu5ttP6Feu"},{"title":"The Night Of","media":"TV","date":"2016-08-28","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","season":"Season 1","rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:33:35.000Z","id":"recNpqChMrhcGS9Ix"},{"title":"Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration","media":"Audiobook","creator":"Ed Catmull","length":368,"year":"2009","date":"2016-08-24","date_updated":"2016-08-19","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","method":["Audiobook"],"isbn":"0812993012","isbn13":9780812993011,"rating":"★★★★★","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"reciEnhdoIe4kg8mf"},{"title":"Hard Style Abs: Hit Hard.

Maybe our secret is actually nothing horrendous. Maybe nobody would even consider it a big deal if it was exposed. But we can’t take that risk. So we keep it buried. Maybe it’s a work impropriety. Or maybe it’s just a feeling that at any moment we’ll blurt something out during some important meeting that’ll prove to everyone that we aren’t proper professional people or, in fact, functional human beings. \n \n\\## Three | The Wilderness \n\\\u003e I suppose that when shamings are delivered like remotely administered drone strikes nobody needs to think about how ferocious our collective power might be.

She said her eeriest memory was how one second the car was her friend, working for her, its contours designed to fit her body perfectly, everything smooth and sleek and luxurious, and then a blink of an eye later it had become a jagged weapon of torture—like she was inside an iron maiden.

Shame, like cold, is, in essence, the absence of warmth. And when it reaches overwhelming intensity, shame is experienced, like cold, as a feeling of numbness and deadness. \\[In Dante’s Inferno]\\(#) the lowest circle of hell was a region not of flames, but of ice—absolute coldness. —JAMES GILLIGAN, Violence: Reflections on Our Deadliest Epidemic \n \n\\\u003e There were glimpses of a summer day through the windows, and as a corrections officer let us in, she said that tensions were high because warm days are when a person really feels incarcerated.\n \n\\## Fourteen | Cats and Ice Cream and Music \n\\\u003e We were creating a world where the smartest way to survive is to be bland.\n \n\\## Fifteen | Your Speed \n\\\u003e But the Internet isn’t about us.

In order to eliminate warping or curvature, a skilled woodworker slowly applies pressure in the opposite direction—essentially, bending it straight. \n \n\\## INTRODUCTION \n\\\u003e The ego we see most commonly goes by a more casual definition: an unhealthy belief in our own importance. Arrogance. Self-centered ambition. \n \n\\\u003e The need to be better than, more than, recognized for, far past any reasonable utility—that’s ego. It’s the sense of superiority and certainty that exceeds the bounds of confidence and talent. \n \n\\\u003e Ego is the voice that tells us we’re better than we really are, we can say ego inhibits true success by preventing a direct and honest connection to the world around us. \n \n\\\u003e When we remove ego, we’re left with what is real. What replaces ego is humility, yes—but rock-hard humility and confidence. Whereas ego is artificial, this type of confidence can hold weight. Ego is stolen. Confidence is earned. Ego is self-anointed, its swagger is artifice. One is girding yourself, the other gas-lighting. It’s the difference between potent and poisonous. \n \n\\## PART I: ASPIRE \n\\\u003e He wanted him to “Be affable in your relations with those who approach you, and never haughty; for the pride of the arrogant even slaves can hardly endure” and “Be slow in deliberation, but be prompt to carry out your resolves” and that the “best thing which we have in ourselves is good judgment.” Constantly train your intellect, he told him, “for the greatest thing in the smallest compass is a sound mind in a human body.” \n \n\\\u003e Among men who rise to fame and leadership two types are recognizable—those who are born with a belief in themselves and those in whom it is a slow growth dependent on actual achievement. To the men of the last type their own success is a constant surprise, and its fruits the more delicious, yet to be tested cautiously with a haunting sense of doubt whether it is not all a dream. In that doubt lies true modesty, not the sham of insincere self-depreciation but the modesty of “moderation,” in the Greek sense. It is poise, not pose. \n \n\\\u003e One might say that the ability to evaluate one’s own ability is the most important skill of all. Without it, improvement is impossible. And certainly ego makes it difficult every step of the way. It is certainly more pleasurable to focus on our talents and strengths, but where does that get us? Arrogance and self-absorption inhibit growth. So does fantasy and “vision.” \n \n\\\u003e What is rare is not raw talent, skill, or even confidence, but humility, diligence, and self-awareness. \n \n\\### TALK, TALK, TALK\n\\\u003e Silence is the respite of the confident and the strong. \n \n\\\u003e “Never give reasons for what you think or do until you must. Maybe, after a while, a better reason will pop into your head.” \n \n\\\u003e Research shows that while goal visualization is important, after a certain point our mind begins to confuse it with actual progress. The same goes for verbalization. Even talking aloud to ourselves while we work through difficult problems has been shown to significantly decrease insight and breakthroughs. After spending so much time thinking, explaining, and talking about a task, we start to feel that we’ve gotten closer to achieving it. Or worse, when things get tough, we feel we can toss the whole project aside because we’ve given it our best try, although of course we haven’t. \n \n\\### TO BE OR TO DO?\n\\\u003e Impressing people is utterly different from being truly impressive. \n \n\\### BECOME A STUDENT\n\\\u003e There is no excuse for not getting your education, and because the information we have before us is so vast, there is no excuse for ever ending that process either. \n \n\\### DON’T BE PASSIONATE\n\\\u003e Remember, “zealot” is just a nice way to say “crazy person.” \n \n\\\u003e Wooden wasn’t about rah-rah speeches or inspiration. He saw those extra emotions as a burden. Instead, his philosophy was about being in control and doing your job and never being “passion’s slave.” \n \n\\\u003e Passion typically masks a weakness. Its breathlessness and impetuousness and franticness are poor substitutes for discipline, for mastery, for strength and purpose and perseverance. You need to be able to spot this in others and in yourself, because while the origins of passion may be earnest and good, its effects are comical and then monstrous. \n \n\\\u003e How can someone be busy and not accomplish anything? Well, that’s the passion paradox. \n \n\\\u003e What humans require in our ascent is purpose and realism. Purpose, you could say, is like passion with boundaries. Realism is detachment and perspective. \n \n\\\u003e Make it about what you feel you must do and say, not what you care about and wish to be. \n \n\\### FOLLOW THE CANVAS STRATEGY\n\\\u003e There’s one fabulous way to work all that out of your system: attach yourself to people and organizations who are already successful and subsume your identity into theirs and move both forward simultaneously. \n \n\\### RESTRAIN YOURSELF\n\\\u003e I have observed that those who have accomplished the greatest results are those who “keep under the body”; are those who never grow excited or lose self-control, but are always calm, self-possessed, patient, and polite. —BOOKER T. WASHINGTON \n \n\\### GET OUT OF YOUR OWN HEAD\n\\\u003e There’s no one to perform for. There is just work to be done and lessons to be learned, in all that is around us. \n \n\\### THE DANGER OF EARLY PRIDE\n\\\u003e Receive feedback, maintain hunger, and chart a proper course in life. Pride dulls these senses. \n \n\\\u003e “Even the tallest mountains have animals that, when they stand on it, are higher than the mountain.” \n \n\\\u003e The question to ask, when you feel pride, then, is this: What am I missing right now that a more humble person might see? \n \n\\### WORK, WORK, WORK\n\\\u003e Each night, before he ever had a reason to, he would flip through the box, make phone calls, write letters, or add notations about their interactions. \n \n\\\u003e There is another apt Latin expression: Materiam superabat opus. (The workmanship was better than the material.) \n \n\\## PART II: SUCCESS \n\\\u003e “Man is pushed by drives,” Viktor Frankl observed. “But he is pulled by values.” \n \n\\### MANAGING YOURSELF\n\\\u003e The public image of Eisenhower is of the man playing golf. In reality, he was not someone who ever slacked off, but the leisure time he did have was available because he ran a tight ship. \n \n\\### BEWARE THE DISEASE OF ME\n\\\u003e The Innocent Climb, Pat Riley says, is almost always followed by the “Disease of Me.” It can “strike any winning team in any year and at any moment,” and does with alarming regularity. \n \n\\\u003e For us, it’s beginning to think that we’re better, that we’re special, that our problems and experiences are so incredibly different from everyone else’s that no one could possibly understand. It’s an attitude that has sunk far better people, teams, and causes than ours. \n \n\\\u003e He had the same traits that everyone has—ego, self-interest, pride, dignity, ambition—but they were “tempered by a sense of humility and selflessness.” \n \n\\\u003e Play for the name on the front of the jersey, he says, and they’ll remember the name on the back. \n \n\\### MEDITATE ON THE IMMENSITY\n\\\u003e “When I look up in the universe, I know I’m small, but I’m also big. I’m big because I’m connected to the universe and the universe is connected to me.” We just can’t forget which is bigger and which has been here longer. \n \n\\## PART III: FAILURE \n\\### ALIVE TIME OR DEAD TIME?\n\\\u003e According to Greene, there are two types of time in our lives: dead time, when people are passive and waiting, and alive time, when people are learning and acting and utilizing every second. \n \n\\### THE EFFORT IS ENOUGH\n\\\u003e “Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming.” \n \n\\### Fight Club MOMENTS\n\\\u003e In the end, the only way you can appreciate your progress is to stand on the edge of the hole you dug for yourself, look down inside it, and smile fondly at the bloody claw prints that marked your journey up the walls. \n \n\\## Vocabulary\n\n\\- Epicurean - a person devoted to sensual enjoyment, especially that derived from fine food and drink.\n\\- Maladies - a disease or ailment\n\\- Zeal - great energy or enthusiasm in pursuit of a cause or an objective\n\\- Myopic - lacking imagination, foresight, or intellectual insight\n\\- Noxiously - harmful, poisonous, or very unpleasant\n\\- Avidity - extreme eagerness or enthusiasm\n\\- Posits - assume as a fact; put forward as a basis of argument.\n\\- Assiduously - with great care and perseverance.\n\\- Harangue - a lengthy and aggressive speech.\n\\- Sycophants - a person who acts obsequiously toward someone important in order to gain advantage.\n\\- Magnanimous - very generous or forgiving, especially toward a rival or someone less powerful than oneself.\n\\- Ennui - a feeling of listlessness and dissatisfaction arising from a lack of occupation or excitement.\n\\- Fjords - a long, narrow, deep inlet of the sea between high cliffs, as in Norway and Iceland, typically formed by submergence of a glaciated valley.\n\\- Conscription - compulsory enlistment for state service, typically into the armed forces.\n\\- Machinations - engage in plots and intrigues; scheme.\n\\- Amalgam - a mixture or blend\n\\- Sycophancy - a person who acts obsequiously toward someone important in order to gain advantage.\n\\- Self-Effacingly - not claiming attention for oneself; retiring and modest\n","method":["Digital"],"rating":"★★★★★","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recVI5IQVbt3aD6J1"},{"title":"Trust Me, I'm Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator","media":"Book","creator":"Ryan Holiday","length":270,"year":"2012","date":"2016-08-02","date_updated":"2016-02-10","status":"Complete","summary":"\\## Book Two: The Monster Attacks: What Blogs Mean \n\n\\### XVIII The Iterative Hustle: Online Journalism’s Bogus Philosophy\n\\\u003e The poet Hesiod once wrote that rumor and gossip are a “light weight to lift up, but heavy to carry and hard to put down.” \n \n\\### XIX The Myth of Corrections\n\\\u003e The human mind “first believes, then evaluates,” as one psychologist put it. To that I’d add, “as long as it doesn’t get distracted first.”\n \n\\### XXI The Dark Side of Snark: When Internet Humor Attacks\n\\\u003e New Yorker critic David Denby came closest to properly defining snark in his book Snark: It’s Mean, It’s Personal, and It’s Ruining Our Conversation. He didn’t succeed entirely, but “snark attempts to steal someone’s mojo, erase her cool, annihilate her effectiveness with the nasty, insidious, rug-pulling, teasing insult, which makes reference to some generally understood shared prejudice or distaste” will do. \n \n\\### Conclusion: So…Where to From Here? \n\\\u003e When intelligent people read, they ask themselves a simple question: What do I plan to do with this information? \n \n\\## Vocabulary\n\n\\- Schlock - cheap or inferior goods or material; trash: they peddle their schlock to willing tourists\n\\- Assuaging - make (an unpleasant feeling) less intense: the letter assuaged the fears of most members.\n\\- Demagoguery - a political leader who seeks support by appealing to popular desires and prejudices rather than by using rational argument.\n\\- Pariah - an outcast: they were treated as social pariahs.\n\\- Megalomaniac - a person who is obsessed with their own power.\n","method":["Digital"],"rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"rec4rKzhu5g9vGTOT"},{"title":"Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win","media":"Audiobook","creator":"Jocko Willink","length":320,"year":"2015","date":"2016-07-01","date_updated":"2016-03-23","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","method":["Audiobook"],"isbn":"1250067057","isbn13":9781250067050,"rating":"★★★★★","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"rec3XXUUbok0NyVH7"},{"title":"Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future","media":"Audiobook","creator":"Ashlee Vance","length":392,"year":"2015","date":"2016-06-20","date_updated":"2016-06-20","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","method":["Audiobook"],"isbn":"0062301233","isbn13":9780062301239,"rating":"★★★★★","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recxIs4VvqnJ8wI70"},{"title":"The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph","media":"Book","creator":"Ryan Holiday","length":201,"year":"2014","date":"2016-06-17","date_updated":"2016-06-17","status":"Complete","summary":"\\## Introduction \n\\\u003e Not: This is not so bad. But: I can make this good. \n \n\\\u003e Objective judgment, now at this very moment. Unselfish action, now at this very moment. Willing acceptance—now at this very moment—of all external events. That’s all you need. —MARCUS AURELIUS \n \n\\## PART I: PERCEPTION \n\\### RECOGNIZE YOUR POWER\n\\\u003e There is no good or bad without us, there is only perception. There is the event itself and the story we tell ourselves about what it means.\n \n\\### PRACTICE OBJECTIVITY\n\\\u003e Take your situation and pretend it is not happening to you. Pretend it is not important, that it doesn’t matter. How much easier would it be for you to know what to do? How much more quickly and dispassionately could you size up the scenario and its options? You could write it off, greet it calmly. \n \n\\### ALTER YOUR PERSPECTIVE\n\\\u003e Perspective is everything. That is, when you can break apart something, or look at it from some new angle, it loses its power over you. \n \n\\\u003e What we can do is limit and expand our perspective to whatever will keep us calmest and most ready for the task at hand.\n \n\\### IS IT UP TO YOU?\n\\\u003e He understood that as a professional athlete his job was to parse the difference between the unlikely and the impossible. \n \n\\## Preface \n\\\u003e And from what we know, he truly saw each and every one of these obstacles as an opportunity to practice some virtue: patience, courage, humility, resourcefulness, reason, justice, and creativity. \n \n\\## PART II: ACTION \n\\### IN PRAISE OF THE FLANK ATTACK\n\\\u003e You don’t convince people by challenging their longest and most firmly held opinions. You find common ground and work from there. Or you look for leverage to make them listen. Or you create an alternative with so much support from other people that the opposition voluntarily abandons its views and joins your camp. \n \n\\### USE OBSTACLES AGAINST THEMSELVES\n\\\u003e Remember, a castle can be an intimidating, impenetrable fortress, or it can be turned into a prison when surrounded. \n \n\\### CHANNEL YOUR ENERGY\n\\\u003e To be physically and mentally loose takes no talent. That’s just recklessness. (We want right action, not action period.) To be physically and mentally tight? That’s called anxiety. It doesn’t work, either. Eventually we snap. But physical looseness combined with mental restraint? That is powerful. It’s a power that drives our opponents and competitors nuts. They think we’re toying with them. It’s maddening—like we aren’t even trying, like we’ve tuned out the world. Like we’re immune to external stressors and limitations on the march toward our goals. Because we are. \n\n\\## PART III: WILL \n\\### BUILD YOUR INNER CITADEL\n\\\u003e We craft our spiritual strength through physical exercise, and our physical hardiness through mental practice (mens sana in corpore)\n \n\\### BUILD YOUR INNER CITADEL\n\\\u003e During the good times, we strengthen ourselves and our bodies so that during the difficult times, we can depend on it. \n \n\\## Final Thoughts: The Obstacle Becomes the Way \n\\\u003e First, see clearly. Next, act correctly. Finally, endure and accept the world as it is. \n \n\\\u003e Vires acquirit eundo (We gather strength as we go). \n \n\\\u003e See things for what they are. Do what we can. Endure and bear what we must. What blocked the path now is a path. What once impeded action advances action. The Obstacle is the Way. \n \n\\## Vocabulary\n\n\\- Ennui - a feeling of listlessness and dissatisfaction arising from a lack of occupation or excitement.\n\\- Emulsified - make into or become an emulsion\n","method":["Digital"],"isbn":"1591846358","isbn13":9781591846352,"rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"rec3m4CojbwCRZMos"},{"title":"Out of the Rough: Inside the Ropes with the World's Greatest Golfers","media":"Book","creator":"Steve     Williams","length":272,"year":"2015","date":"2016-05-29","date_updated":"2016-05-29","status":"Complete","summary":"\n","method":["Digital"],"rating":"★★★★☆","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recIxPjrGJG7GTh5W"},{"title":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Harry Potter, #7)","media":"Book","creator":"J.K.

It’s on.” \n \n\\## Day 4: Fitness Test \n\\\u003e I don’t think about yesterday. I think about today and getting better. \n \n\\\u003e We do five pull-ups (nickels) and then ten push-ups (dimes) “every minute on the minute.” We start every time the second hand is on the 12. If we finish in forty seconds, we then have twenty seconds of rest. We do this for ten minutes (fifty pull-ups and a hundred push-ups). \n \n\\## Day 5: Escape Vehicle \n\\\u003e It doesn’t have to be fun. It has to be effective. —SEAL \n \n\\\u003e “When you think you’re done, you’re only at forty percent of what your body is capable of doing. That’s just the limit that we put on ourselves.” \n \n\\## Day 9: Oxygen Deprivation \n\\\u003e Man, we start, and then, motherfucker, we finish. \n \n\\## Day 10: The Honor Code \n\\\u003e This is our push-up routine: Do one push-up then stand up and wait fifteen seconds, then go down and do two push-ups and wait fifteen seconds and so on, until we get up to ten push-ups, and then we start taking thirty-second breaks. For push-ups sixteen, seventeen, and eighteen, SEAL allows us to take forty-five seconds between sets. \n \n\\## Day 13: Sick Fuck Friday \n\\\u003e “Whatever you got going on, someone else has more pain. You gotta learn how to fight through it. No matter what it is… Think about someone else and take a suck-shit pill.” \n \n\\## Day 14: Fireman’s Carry \n\\\u003e If you can’t do the basics, you can’t do shit. —SEAL \n \n\\## Day 17: Suicide Bombers \n\\\u003e Dumbbell bench press: 15 reps at 35 pounds, 12 reps at 40 pounds, 10 reps at 45 pounds, 8 reps at 50 pounds, and then 6 reps at 55 pounds. \n \n\\\u003e “Money is fun to make, fun to spend, and fun to give away. That sums it all up.” \n \n\\## Day 21: One Rep at a Time \n\\\u003e “Hey, SEAL, what do you think about when you run?” “Finishing.” \n \n\\## Day 26: Primary Target \n\\\u003e “Say, SEAL,” I say. “What would you do if there was an intruder in the house?” Slowly SEAL turns and looks at me. He holds me with an even, unemotional stare. Then he turns back to the TV without answering my question. “No, really,” I say. “What would you do?” He shakes his head slowly. “I think you know what I’d do,” he says to the TV. “Tell me.” “I would protect the primary.” “What’s the primary?” “That’s the million-dollar question,” he says. “What is your primary, Jesse? What would hurt you the most to lose? This big-screen TV? Those gold record awards you own? Jewelry? Cash? What do you hold most dear?” “No,” I say. “None of that.” “Well?” he asks. “My wife and my son.” “Exactly, Jesse,” he says. “They’re your primary, and as long as I’m in this house they’re my primary too. You asked me what I would do. I would protect my primary at any cost. And unfortunately for you, you’re my third option.”\n \n\\## Day 27: 1,000 Push-ups \n\\\u003e I don’t celebrate victories but I learn from failures. —SEAL \n","method":["Digital"],"isbn":"1455534676","isbn13":9781455534678,"rating":"★★★★★","created_time":"2020-12-09T15:27:28.000Z","id":"recJubgzbPlybNivB"},{"title":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter, #6)","media":"Book","creator":"J.K.
