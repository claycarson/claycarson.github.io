<p class="intro">Here is a list of my lists. I mostly keep these lists for the sake of my own memory.</p>

<h2>Listening</h2>
<p><small>These are my favorite albums. But more-so, they are the albums I do not want to forget.</small></p>
</a>

<a href="/watching/movies" class="postlink">
<time></time>
<h2>Movies</h2>
<p><small>As far as I know, this is the complete list of every movie I have ever seen.</small></p>
</a>

<section>
<a href="/watching/series" class="postlink">
<time></time>
<h2>Series</h2>
<p><small>It is hard to consider this a complete list since series tend to come and go but I do my best to keep track.</small></p>
</a>

<section>
<a href="/reading/books" class="postlink">
<time></time>
<h2>Books</h2>
<p><small>I attribute my increased reading in recent years to the Amazon Kindle. The portability and ease of highlighting passages makes it indispensable.</small></p>
</a>

<section>
<a href="/reading/audiobooks" class="postlink">
<time></time>
<h2>Audiobooks</h2>
<p><small>Audiobooks really got me interested in 'reading' several years ago. The truth is, the increase in good podcast content has slowed my audiobook consumption.</small></p>

<a href="/gaming" class="postlink">
<time></time>
<h2>Gaming</h2>
<p><small>In the spring of 2019 I built my first PC. Naturally, I felt the need to log the games I complete or play extensively. I do hope to go back one day and catalog my previous gaming life.</small></p>

<time></time>
<h2>Baseball Stadiums</h2>
<p><small>I don't have a life long goal of going to every baseball team's stadium but it might be cool.</small></p>
