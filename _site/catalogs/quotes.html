<p>I collect quotes like trading cards. I don’t have a strong criteria for inclusion in this list: if the
quote was remarkable in any way (a clever turn of phrase, an interesting concept, a pithy aphorism,
a useful insight, a beautiful piece of diction) I’ll add it here. At some point I might try and 
make this entire enterprise a little more organize with tags and such, but that seems unnecessary
while the number of quotes is still less than a thousand: it is hard to displace the ergonomics of Command &amp; F.</p>

      <div class="tabular-content-text">
         <p>Onitsuka asked what we thought [new shoe] should be called. Bowerman liked “Aztec,” in homage to the 1968 Olympics, which were being held in Mexico City. I liked that, too. Fine, Onitsuka said.</p>

<p>The Aztec was born. And then Adidas threatened to sue. Adidas already had a new shoe named the “Azteca Gold,” a track spike they were planning to introduce at the same Olympics. No one had ever heard of it, but that didn’t stop Adidas from kicking up a fuss.</p>

<p>Aggravated, I drove up the mountain to Bowerman’s house to talk it all over. We sat on the wide porch, looking down at the river. It sparkled that day like a silver shoelace. He took off his ball cap, put it on again, rubbed his face. “Who was that guy who kicked the shit out of the Aztecs?” he asked. “Cortez,” I said. He grunted. “Okay. Let’s call it the Cortez.”</p>
