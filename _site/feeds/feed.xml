        <description>&lt;p&gt;This newsletter is a collection of things I have found in the last month that I enjoyed, found interesting, or simply wanted to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow me more closely at &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.net&quot; title=&quot;Personal Website&quot;&gt;my personal website&lt;/a&gt; or if you or someone you know is looking to buy or sell a home, you can point them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.com&quot; title=&quot;Business Website &quot;&gt;my real estate website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I briefly spoke about this over email with Elizabeth Joh, a University of California, Davis, School of Law professor, who reminded me: “You never just ‘buy’ a new surveillance device. You’ve adopted a worldview about privacy, anonymity and autonomy — whether by conscious choice or accident.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quoted law professor Elizabeth Joh also co-hosts the tremendously educational podcast, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.radiotopia.fm/podcasts/trump-con-law&quot;&gt;What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On a Saturday in late October, my cell phone rang and it was Bill Perocchi, the CEO of Pebble Beach Company, and he asked me if I could play. If you ever get one of those calls, yes is the answer. Yes, sweet mother of pearl, yes. Then a leather-bound invitation arrives in the mail with Clint Eastwood’s signature. You send in your check and you’re in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For more than half a century, governments all over the world trusted a single company to keep the communications of their spies, soldiers and diplomats secret.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The company, Crypto AG, got its first break with a contract to build code-making machines for U.S. troops during World War II. Flush with cash, it became a dominant maker of encryption devices for decades, navigating waves of technology from mechanical gears to electronic circuits and, finally, silicon chips and software.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Swiss firm made millions of dollars selling equipment to more than 120 countries well into the 21st century. Its clients included Iran, military juntas in Latin America, nuclear rivals India and Pakistan, and even the Vatican.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But what none of its customers ever knew was that Crypto AG was secretly owned by the CIA in a highly classified partnership with West German intelligence. These spy agencies rigged the company’s devices so they could easily break the codes that countries used to send encrypted messages.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This newsletter is a collection of things I have found in the last month that I enjoyed, found interesting, or simply wanted to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow me more closely at &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.net&quot; title=&quot;Personal Website&quot;&gt;my personal website&lt;/a&gt; or if you or someone you know is looking to buy or sell a home, you can point them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.com&quot; title=&quot;Business Website &quot;&gt;my real estate website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;transcendent&quot;&gt;Transcendent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html&quot; title=&quot;Roger Federer as Religious Experience&quot;&gt;Roger Federer as Religious Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The metaphysical explanation is that Roger Federer is one of those rare, preternatural athletes who appear to be exempt, at least in part, from certain physical laws. Good analogues here include Michael Jordan, who could not only jump inhumanly high but actually hang there a beat or two longer than gravity allows, and Muhammad Ali, who really could “float” across the canvas and land two or three jabs in the clock-time required for one. There are probably a half-dozen other examples since 1960. And Federer is of this type — a type that one could call genius, or mutant, or avatar. He is never hurried or off-balance. The approaching ball hangs, for him, a split-second longer than it ought to. His movements are lithe rather than athletic. Like Ali, Jordan, Maradona, and Gretzky, he seems both less and more substantial than the men he faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;does-it-do-anything-it-tells-the-time&quot;&gt;“Does it Do Anything?” “It Tells the Time.”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/watches-james-bond-why-they-matter-in-depth&quot; title=&quot;The Watches Of James Bond &quot;&gt;The Watches Of James Bond&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And what of James Bond’s watches? From a few clues in Fleming’s novels, we learn that 007 wears a “heavy Rolex Oyster” of some sort, with a luminous dial and expanding metal bracelet. It was possibly an Explorer, the watch of the author himself, who no doubt wore it on his spearfishing excursions from his Jamaican beach villa. This was the 1950s, when steel Rolex sports watches were in their infancy and Bond treats his like the tool it was, not the luxury accessory or status symbol it would become. In the novel, On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, he brandishes it as a “knuckle duster”, wrapping it across his fist to render a henchman unconscious in the ski room of a mountaintop hideout. Upon later reflection, Bond decides he can get his shattered watch replaced with a stipend from MI-6, and will probably get another Rolex, which Bond feels no particular affection for, but likes because they’re heavy and easy to read. No more, no less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;just-a-bit-outside&quot;&gt;Just a Bit Outside&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://technology.mlblogs.com/mlb-ground-truth-testing-ec87c73450b9&quot;&gt;How does MLB check the accuracy of pitch tracking at ballparks?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ground truth method relies on the frame-synchronized filming of a ball passing over the plate by two high-speed cameras. WSU uses Phantom cameras which operate at 2500 frames per second (fps). These 1920×1200 cameras are focused down to a field of view (FOV) of 5 x 3 ft on the space surrounding the strike zone as in Figure 2. This yields a spatial resolution of about 0.03 inches/pixel within the camera’s field depth. Exposure times of 50 µs allow still images from video with a motion blur of less than 80 thousandths of an inch (&amp;lt; 0.080”) as shown in Figure 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;track-attack&quot;&gt;Track Attack&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html&quot;&gt;One Nation, Tracked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are living in the world’s most advanced surveillance system. This system wasn’t created deliberately. It was built through the interplay of technological advance and the profit motive. It was built to make money. The greatest trick technology companies ever played was persuading society to surveil itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;younger-guns&quot;&gt;Younger Guns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.golfdigest.com/story/a-week-behind-the-scenes-with-two-college-golf-powerhouses&quot; title=&quot;A week behind the scenes with two college golf powerhouses&quot;&gt;A week behind the scenes with two college golf powerhouses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With an effortless motion, Davenport hits soaring rifle-shot irons that land like warm dumplings. Watching elite college athletes smash 6-irons and launch drives on gravity-defying lines is a mystifying experience. The speed, sound and sense of compression seem to defy physics. Most elite Division I players arrive on campus with all of this figured out, their swings more or less grooved to the current technology and requirements of modern tournament golf. They come to places like Vanderbilt and Texas because they want to compete and win titles, but also because they know the coaches there can help them realize their dream—a professional career—which is on the mind of virtually every college player, at least initially. They choose programs because there’s evidence of this, rosters of former players on the PGA Tour. The job of Limbaugh, Fields and their brethren, therefore, is to help these kids round out their games, to develop their competitive character and situational awareness. College coaching is largely, on a fundamental level, teaching course management and honing instincts beyond shooting yardages and firing at pins, which is what all exceptional 17-year-olds do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace…In ancient days, men looked at stars and saw their heroes in the constellations. In modern times, we do much the same, but our heroes are epic men of flesh and blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MIT Center for Advanced Virtuality has taken audio and video of Nixon and &lt;a href=&quot;https://moondisaster.org&quot;&gt;created a fake film&lt;/a&gt; of William Safire’s speech in the event of an Apollo 11 disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The fans who needed tickets stood out. We called them “straights” because they stand straight up in a crowd protecting the cash they’re unused to carrying, hands stuck in their pockets, and you could make a few thousand dollars in a couple of hours if you knew how to spot them. The game was to sell your tickets for as much cash as the straights could cough up.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I had 30 tickets left with 20 minutes to kickoff. If I didn’t sell them they’d be worthless — deadwood. But with undercovers swarming the stadium, the risk of arrest swelled with every sale. Ticket scalping in Brazil carried a multi-year prison sentence, and I couldn’t speak Portuguese, so I had to be careful. Avoiding capture meant closing deals quickly and moving every five minutes. These were techniques my mentors taught me on street corners, outside the track at the Kentucky Derby, in the parking lots bordering the Masters, the hotel lobbies by the Super Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This newsletter is a collection of things I have found in the last month that I enjoyed, found interesting, or simply wanted to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow me more closely at &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.net&quot; title=&quot;Personal Website&quot;&gt;my personal website&lt;/a&gt; or if you or someone you know is looking to buy or sell a home, you can point them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.com&quot; title=&quot;Business Website &quot;&gt;my real estate website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;code-red&quot;&gt;Code Red&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/technology/2019/10/consequential-computer-code-software-history.html&quot;&gt;The Lines of Code That Changed Everything&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To shed light on the software that has tilted the world on its axis, the editors polled computer scientists, software developers, historians, policymakers, and journalists. They were asked to pick: Which pieces of code had a huge influence? Which ones warped our lives? About 75 responded with all sorts of ideas, and Slate has selected 36. It’s not a comprehensive list—it couldn’t be, given the massive welter of influential code that’s been written. (One fave of mine that didn’t make the cut: “Quicksort”! Or maybe Ada Lovelace’s Bernoulli algorithm.) Like all lists, it’s meant to provoke thought—to help us ponder anew how code undergirds our lives and how decisions made by programmers ripple into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some personal favorite: The Apollo 11 Lunar Module’s BAILOUT Code, The One-Line Virus, The HTML Hyperlink, The Code That Made a T-Shirt Illegal, RSS, The Lost Mars Climate Orbiter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;words-words-words&quot;&gt;Words, Words, Words&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/10/14/can-a-machine-learn-to-write-for-the-new-yorker?mbid=social_twitter&amp;amp;utm_brand=tny&amp;amp;utm_social-type=owned&quot;&gt;Can a Machine Learn to Write for The New Yorker?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To understand how GPT-2 writes, imagine that you’ve never learned any spelling or grammar rules, and that no one taught you what words mean. All you know is what you’ve read in eight million articles that you discovered via Reddit, on an almost infinite variety of topics (although subjects such as Miley Cyrus and the Mueller report are more familiar to you than, say, the Treaty of Versailles). You have Rain Man-like skills for remembering each and every combination of words you’ve read. Because of your predictive-text neural net, if you are given a sentence and asked to write another like it, you can do the task flawlessly without understanding anything about the rules of language. The only skill you need is being able to accurately predict the next word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;money-buys&quot;&gt;Money Buys…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Peter Rahal, the 33-year-old energy bar impresario who sold RxBar to Kellogg for $600 million and became something of a consumer products legend in the process, stands in the gigantic, spotless kitchen of his new Miami Beach mansion. Behind him, floor-to-ceiling windows revealed his pool, his outdoor bar, and Sunset Harbour. Throughout the house are expensive-looking modernist metal chandeliers. The kitchen drawers are filled with gold utensils.
[…]
Rahal prides himself on struggle and says that’s how he built RxBar into a breakout success. Yet now he exists in a rich person’s wonderland, where workers appear and disappear on some imperceptible schedule to clean the pool or fix the elevator, where the kitchen’s surfaces are entirely smooth and glossy. The many contradictions now swirling in Rahal’s daily existence are not lost on him. “As life moves forward,” he says, “an easier life isn’t always a better life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow me more closely at &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.net&quot; title=&quot;Personal Website&quot;&gt;my personal website&lt;/a&gt; or if you or someone you know is looking to buy or sell a home, you can point them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.com&quot; title=&quot;Business Website &quot;&gt;my real estate website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s not difficult to piece it together: With a video camera rolling, Richard would launch the balloon and freak out. He’d call the FAA and get the balloon tracked. There’d be a tearful reunion when Falcon emerged from the basement, where he’d been told to hide. Richard would call back and say his son wasn’t in the basket. They’d make sure the Fort Collins newspaper knew about the stray saucer and the drama behind it. The story might go nationwide. With publicity in full force and a recording of every moment, networks would fight over the Heenes’ story.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Except Falcon didn’t hide where he was told to. He hid in the garage attic, not in the basement. He played with his cars and he fell asleep. The FAA said Richard needed to call 911. Deputies showed up. Neighbors began searching for Falcon. And then that silvery balloon was careening across our television screens. That’s why Mayumi’s reunion with Falcon was so believable: For a few hours, she and Richard honestly worried their son had been swept away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 2004, winner Rustam Kasimdzhanov walked away from the six-game world championship having lost 17 pounds. In October 2018, Polar, a U.S.-based company that tracks heart rates, monitored chess players during a tournament and found that 21-year-old Russian grandmaster Mikhail Antipov had burned 560 calories in two hours of sitting and playing chess – or roughly what Roger Federer would burn in an hour of singles tennis.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This newsletter is a collection of things I have found in the last month that I enjoyed, found interesting, or simply wanted to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow me more closely at &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.net&quot; title=&quot;Personal Website&quot;&gt;my personal website&lt;/a&gt; or if you or someone you know is looking to buy or sell a home, you can point them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.com&quot; title=&quot;Business Website &quot;&gt;my real estate website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-case-of-the-mondays&quot;&gt;A Case of the Monday’s&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.golf.com/news/features/2019/08/14/ryan-french-unearthing-triumphs-tragedies-monday-qualifier-life/&quot; title=&quot;Meet the man unearthing the triumphs (and tragedies) of Monday-qualifier life&quot;&gt;Meet the Man Unearthing the Triumphs (and Tragedies) of Monday-Qualifier Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every Monday the PGA Tour holds a “small” tournament to get into the week’s “big” tournament. Four spots are up for grabs and there are often over 100 vagabonding golfers trying to play their way in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I think golf is thought of as so elitist, epically pro golf — private jets and big money and handing out gloves — so I don’t think people knew this side of it existed,” French says. “They know minor-league baseball because everyone’s been to a minor-league baseball game. It’s organized. Monday qualifying is just so fractured. I don’t think people knew it existed, at least your casual golf fan didn’t. They didn’t realize there were people grinding out there sleeping in cars, and I think that’s the human interest of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorites of French’s tweets are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/acaseofthegolf1/status/1163104881454014466&quot;&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/acaseofthegolf1/status/1152708850048471041&quot;&gt;summarize&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/acaseofthegolf1/status/1157062316871114752&quot;&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/acaseofthegolf1/status/1162323389069111297&quot;&gt;play&lt;/a&gt; so &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/acaseofthegolf1/status/1162417675894759424&quot;&gt;simply&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;brains-are-weird&quot;&gt;Brains Are Weird&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/magazine/placebo-effect-medicine.html&quot; title=&quot;What if the Placebo Effect Isn’t a Trick?&quot;&gt;What if the Placebo Effect Isn’t a Trick?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And after a quarter-century of hard work, they have abundant evidence to prove it. Give people a sugar pill, they have shown, and those patients — especially if they have one of the chronic, stress-related conditions that register the strongest placebo effects and if the treatment is delivered by someone in whom they have confidence — will improve. Tell someone a normal milkshake is a diet beverage, and his gut will respond as if the drink were low fat. Take athletes to the top of the Alps, put them on exercise machines and hook them to an oxygen tank, and they will perform better than when they are breathing room air — even if room air is all that’s in the tank. Wake a patient from surgery and tell him you’ve done an arthroscopic repair, and his knee gets better even if all you did was knock him out and put a couple of incisions in his skin. Give a drug a fancy name, and it works better than if you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You don’t even have to deceive the patients. You can hand a patient with irritable bowel syndrome a sugar pill, identify it as such and tell her that sugar pills are known to be effective when used as placebos, and she will get better, especially if you take the time to deliver that message with warmth and close attention. Depression, back pain, chemotherapy-related malaise, migraine, post-traumatic stress disorder: The list of conditions that respond to placebos — as well as they do to drugs, with some patients — is long and growing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Much like walking through a real-life museum, Version Museum aims to illustrate the visual, tangible elements of various versions of technology, rather than just the written history behind it. Wikipedia and other sites already do a fantastic job of detailing the story behind websites, apps, and everything else. This site focuses on observable changes over time. If you’re a longtime user of a certain product, there’s probably going to be some nostalgia as you look at all the previous iterations of it over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-crapture&quot;&gt;“The (C)Rapture”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/pooping-dark/?verso=true&quot; title=&quot;On Pooping in the Dark—No Lights, No Phones, No Distractions&quot;&gt;On Pooping in the Dark—No Lights, No Phones, No Distractions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I used to DM during every BM. Then, one afternoon a few years ago, I slipped into a poop portal. Backpacking through remote wilderness in searing heat, I felt the telltale pang. Coffee, eggs, chorizo, and water were all rushing—screamingly—to the exits. At the nearest rest stop, I dashed into a bathroom so single-mindedly I didn’t turn on the lights and collapsed onto the toilet. The immediate release, shrouded as it was in shadow, was cosmic, like waking up from a nightmare, realizing it’s Christmas, I’m 5 years old, and can fly. Though I haven’t yet been able to recreate every condition, to this day I try to dump in total darkness: no lights, no phone, the gulf between mind and body quaked shut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ring-ring&quot;&gt;Ring, Ring&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mb88za/amazon-requires-police-to-shill-surveillance-cameras-in-secret-agreement?xyz&quot; title=&quot;Amazon Requires Police to Shill Surveillance Cameras in Secret Agreement&quot;&gt;Amazon Requires Police to Shill Surveillance Cameras in Secret Agreement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Amazon’s home security company Ring has enlisted local police departments around the country to advertise its surveillance cameras in exchange for free Ring products and a “portal” that allows police to request footage from these cameras, a secret agreement obtained by Motherboard shows. The agreement also requires police to “keep the terms of this program confidential.”
[…]
People often buy and use Ring doorbell cameras under the premise that they’re making their individual homes safer. But these people aren’t just making choices for themselves. They’re consenting to surveilling everyone in their neighborhood and anyone who comes in the vicinity of their home, including friends and family, delivery workers, and anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Further entrenching automobile supremacy are laws that require landowners who build housing and office space to build housing for cars as well. In large part because of parking quotas, parking lots now cover more than a third of the land area of some U.S. cities; Houston is estimated to have 30 parking spaces for every resident. As the UCLA urban-planning professor Donald Shoup has written, this mismatch flows from legal mandates rather than market demand. Every employee who brings a car to the office essentially doubles the amount of space he takes up at work, and in urban areas his employer may be required by law to build him a $50,000 garage parking space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A good golf course is a great asset to the nation. Those who harangue against land being diverted from agriculture and used for golf have little sense of proportion. Comparing the small amount of land utilised for golf with the large amount devoted to agriculture, we get infinitely more value out of the former than the latter. We all eat too much. During the Great War the majority were all the fitter for being rationed and getting a smaller amount of food, but none of us get enough fresh air, pleasurable excitement, and exercise. Health and happiness are everything in this world.
&lt;em&gt;- Dr. Alister MacKenzie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This newsletter is a collection of things I have found in the last month that I enjoyed, found interesting, or simply wanted to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow me more closely at &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.net&quot; title=&quot;Personal Website&quot;&gt;my personal website&lt;/a&gt; or if you or someone you know is looking to buy or sell a home, you can point them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.com&quot; title=&quot;Business Website &quot;&gt;my real estate website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;Ow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/06/07/the-underground-art-of-prison-tattoos&quot;&gt;The Underground Art of Prison Tattoos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Prisoners take apart beard trimmers or CD players to get at the tiny motor, which they can adapt to make the tattoo needle go up and down quickly enough.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The needle itself is often made from a metal guitar string split in two by holding it over an open flame until it snaps in half, creating a fine point. The springs inside gel pens can also flatten into needles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One former prisoner who now runs a tattoo shop said he used to make black ink by trapping soot in a milk carton placed over a burning pile of plastic razors or Bible pages. He would mix the leftover ash and soot with a bit of alcohol (for hygienic purposes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;go-no-go&quot;&gt;Go, No Go&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apolloinrealtime.org/11/&quot;&gt;Apollo 11 in Real Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This website replays the Apollo 11 mission as it happened, 50 years ago. It consists entirely of historical material, all timed to Ground Elapsed Time–the master mission clock. Footage of Mission Control, film shot by the astronauts, and television broadcasts transmitted from space and the surface of the Moon, have been painstakingly placed to the very moments they were shot during the mission, as has every photograph taken, and every word spoken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That car horn beeps an F major chord, this kettle’s in A flat, some bedside lights get thrown out because they are out of tune with other appliances…bath taps squeak in E, this person sneezes in E flat. That printer’s in D mostly. The microwave is in the same key as the washing machine.
[…]
When I taste things, I also hear music, mainly chords – sugar and desserts almost always in major key and chocolate and coffee are particularly complex sounds, with overtones and harmonics. I love broccoli and cauliflower which are a cycle of fifths. Sushi tastes like power chords on an acoustic guitar. Lemon meringue pie is a concoction of A major chords and inversions, 7ths and minors.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This newsletter is a collection of things I have found in the last month that I enjoyed, found interesting, or simply wanted to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow me more closely at &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.net&quot; title=&quot;Personal Website&quot;&gt;my personal website&lt;/a&gt; or if you or someone you know is looking to buy or sell a home, you can point them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.com&quot; title=&quot;Business Website &quot;&gt;my real estate website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bob-why-a-pdf&quot;&gt;Bob, Why a PDF?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pdfa.org/a-technical-and-cultural-assessment-of-the-mueller-report-pdf/&quot; title=&quot;A Technical and Cultural Assessment of the Mueller Report PDF&quot;&gt;A Technical and Cultural Assessment of the Mueller Report PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everyone knew that the US Department of Justice and Attorney General Barr would release the Mueller Report as a PDF file.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In fact, it’s safe to say that AG Barr never considered delivering anything else. No one would have even suggested a Word file, or a set of TIFF images, or a website, or an XPS file, or EPUB, or plain text. It’s 2019, but it seems safe to say that they simply assumed they’d use PDF.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you are like most people, you simply assumed it would be a PDF as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lows-of-colonials-2019-champion&quot;&gt;The Lows of Colonial’s 2019 Champion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On every swing a battle raged between his technical proficiency and mental fragility. He would stand over the ball, his mind jumbled with swing thoughts. His hands strangled the grip, his arms were knots of tension. The seconds would tick by, and he felt powerless to lift the club. Then the uncertainty would ebb just long enough to allow him to start his swing, and the resulting shot would be flawless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously painful to watch: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRKH4nIWRUg&quot; title=&quot;Pull the Trigger!&quot;&gt;Pull the trigger!&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
