&lt;p&gt;You can follow me more closely at &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.net&quot; title=&quot;Personal Website&quot;&gt;my personal website&lt;/a&gt; or if you or someone you know is looking to buy or sell a home, you can point them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.com&quot; title=&quot;Business Website &quot;&gt;my real estate website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;track-attack&quot;&gt;Track Attack&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html&quot;&gt;One Nation, Tracked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are living in the world’s most advanced surveillance system. This system wasn’t created deliberately. It was built through the interplay of technological advance and the profit motive. It was built to make money. The greatest trick technology companies ever played was persuading society to surveil itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;younger-guns&quot;&gt;Younger Guns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.golfdigest.com/story/a-week-behind-the-scenes-with-two-college-golf-powerhouses&quot; title=&quot;A week behind the scenes with two college golf powerhouses&quot;&gt;A week behind the scenes with two college golf powerhouses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With an effortless motion, Davenport hits soaring rifle-shot irons that land like warm dumplings. Watching elite college athletes smash 6-irons and launch drives on gravity-defying lines is a mystifying experience. The speed, sound and sense of compression seem to defy physics. Most elite Division I players arrive on campus with all of this figured out, their swings more or less grooved to the current technology and requirements of modern tournament golf. They come to places like Vanderbilt and Texas because they want to compete and win titles, but also because they know the coaches there can help them realize their dream—a professional career—which is on the mind of virtually every college player, at least initially. They choose programs because there’s evidence of this, rosters of former players on the PGA Tour. The job of Limbaugh, Fields and their brethren, therefore, is to help these kids round out their games, to develop their competitive character and situational awareness. College coaching is largely, on a fundamental level, teaching course management and honing instincts beyond shooting yardages and firing at pins, which is what all exceptional 17-year-olds do.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This newsletter is a collection of things I have found in the last month that I enjoyed, found interesting, or simply wanted to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow me more closely at &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.net&quot; title=&quot;Personal Website&quot;&gt;my personal website&lt;/a&gt; or if you or someone you know is looking to buy or sell a home, you can point them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.com&quot; title=&quot;Business Website &quot;&gt;my real estate website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace…In ancient days, men looked at stars and saw their heroes in the constellations. In modern times, we do much the same, but our heroes are epic men of flesh and blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MIT Center for Advanced Virtuality has taken audio and video of Nixon and &lt;a href=&quot;https://moondisaster.org&quot;&gt;created a fake film&lt;/a&gt; of William Safire’s speech in the event of an Apollo 11 disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for good measure, let’s not forget the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.com/mlb/2019/10/22/houston-astros-roberto-osuna-suspension&quot; title=&quot;Disgusting behavior by Astros’ assistant general manager Brandon Taubman&quot;&gt;disgusting behavior by both the Astros and (former) assistant general manager Brandon Taubman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;need-tickets-need-tickets&quot;&gt;“Need tickets?” “Need tickets.”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sbnation.com/2019/10/9/20876265/ticket-scalping-world-cup-olympics-final-four&quot; title=&quot;Sinners, Scalpers and the Search for God: One man’s descent into the underworld of sports&quot;&gt;Sinners, Scalpers and the Search for God: One man’s descent into the underworld of sports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The fans who needed tickets stood out. We called them “straights” because they stand straight up in a crowd protecting the cash they’re unused to carrying, hands stuck in their pockets, and you could make a few thousand dollars in a couple of hours if you knew how to spot them. The game was to sell your tickets for as much cash as the straights could cough up.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I had 30 tickets left with 20 minutes to kickoff. If I didn’t sell them they’d be worthless — deadwood. But with undercovers swarming the stadium, the risk of arrest swelled with every sale. Ticket scalping in Brazil carried a multi-year prison sentence, and I couldn’t speak Portuguese, so I had to be careful. Avoiding capture meant closing deals quickly and moving every five minutes. These were techniques my mentors taught me on street corners, outside the track at the Kentucky Derby, in the parking lots bordering the Masters, the hotel lobbies by the Super Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow me more closely at &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.net&quot; title=&quot;Personal Website&quot;&gt;my personal website&lt;/a&gt; or if you or someone you know is looking to buy or sell a home, you can point them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.com&quot; title=&quot;Business Website &quot;&gt;my real estate website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;code-red&quot;&gt;Code Red&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/technology/2019/10/consequential-computer-code-software-history.html&quot;&gt;The Lines of Code That Changed Everything&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To shed light on the software that has tilted the world on its axis, the editors polled computer scientists, software developers, historians, policymakers, and journalists. They were asked to pick: Which pieces of code had a huge influence? Which ones warped our lives? About 75 responded with all sorts of ideas, and Slate has selected 36. It’s not a comprehensive list—it couldn’t be, given the massive welter of influential code that’s been written. (One fave of mine that didn’t make the cut: “Quicksort”! Or maybe Ada Lovelace’s Bernoulli algorithm.) Like all lists, it’s meant to provoke thought—to help us ponder anew how code undergirds our lives and how decisions made by programmers ripple into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some personal favorite: The Apollo 11 Lunar Module’s BAILOUT Code, The One-Line Virus, The HTML Hyperlink, The Code That Made a T-Shirt Illegal, RSS, The Lost Mars Climate Orbiter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;words-words-words&quot;&gt;Words, Words, Words&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/10/14/can-a-machine-learn-to-write-for-the-new-yorker?mbid=social_twitter&amp;amp;utm_brand=tny&amp;amp;utm_social-type=owned&quot;&gt;Can a Machine Learn to Write for The New Yorker?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To understand how GPT-2 writes, imagine that you’ve never learned any spelling or grammar rules, and that no one taught you what words mean. All you know is what you’ve read in eight million articles that you discovered via Reddit, on an almost infinite variety of topics (although subjects such as Miley Cyrus and the Mueller report are more familiar to you than, say, the Treaty of Versailles). You have Rain Man-like skills for remembering each and every combination of words you’ve read. Because of your predictive-text neural net, if you are given a sentence and asked to write another like it, you can do the task flawlessly without understanding anything about the rules of language. The only skill you need is being able to accurately predict the next word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Peter Rahal, the 33-year-old energy bar impresario who sold RxBar to Kellogg for $600 million and became something of a consumer products legend in the process, stands in the gigantic, spotless kitchen of his new Miami Beach mansion. Behind him, floor-to-ceiling windows revealed his pool, his outdoor bar, and Sunset Harbour. Throughout the house are expensive-looking modernist metal chandeliers. The kitchen drawers are filled with gold utensils.
[…]
Rahal prides himself on struggle and says that’s how he built RxBar into a breakout success. Yet now he exists in a rich person’s wonderland, where workers appear and disappear on some imperceptible schedule to clean the pool or fix the elevator, where the kitchen’s surfaces are entirely smooth and glossy. The many contradictions now swirling in Rahal’s daily existence are not lost on him. “As life moves forward,” he says, “an easier life isn’t always a better life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s not difficult to piece it together: With a video camera rolling, Richard would launch the balloon and freak out. He’d call the FAA and get the balloon tracked. There’d be a tearful reunion when Falcon emerged from the basement, where he’d been told to hide. Richard would call back and say his son wasn’t in the basket. They’d make sure the Fort Collins newspaper knew about the stray saucer and the drama behind it. The story might go nationwide. With publicity in full force and a recording of every moment, networks would fight over the Heenes’ story.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Except Falcon didn’t hide where he was told to. He hid in the garage attic, not in the basement. He played with his cars and he fell asleep. The FAA said Richard needed to call 911. Deputies showed up. Neighbors began searching for Falcon. And then that silvery balloon was careening across our television screens. That’s why Mayumi’s reunion with Falcon was so believable: For a few hours, she and Richard honestly worried their son had been swept away.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In 2004, winner Rustam Kasimdzhanov walked away from the six-game world championship having lost 17 pounds. In October 2018, Polar, a U.S.-based company that tracks heart rates, monitored chess players during a tournament and found that 21-year-old Russian grandmaster Mikhail Antipov had burned 560 calories in two hours of sitting and playing chess – or roughly what Roger Federer would burn in an hour of singles tennis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every Monday the PGA Tour holds a “small” tournament to get into the week’s “big” tournament. Four spots are up for grabs and there are often over 100 vagabonding golfers trying to play their way in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I think golf is thought of as so elitist, epically pro golf — private jets and big money and handing out gloves — so I don’t think people knew this side of it existed,” French says. “They know minor-league baseball because everyone’s been to a minor-league baseball game. It’s organized. Monday qualifying is just so fractured. I don’t think people knew it existed, at least your casual golf fan didn’t. They didn’t realize there were people grinding out there sleeping in cars, and I think that’s the human interest of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorites of French’s tweets are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/acaseofthegolf1/status/1163104881454014466&quot;&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/acaseofthegolf1/status/1152708850048471041&quot;&gt;summarize&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/acaseofthegolf1/status/1157062316871114752&quot;&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/acaseofthegolf1/status/1162323389069111297&quot;&gt;play&lt;/a&gt; so &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/acaseofthegolf1/status/1162417675894759424&quot;&gt;simply&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;brains-are-weird&quot;&gt;Brains Are Weird&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/magazine/placebo-effect-medicine.html&quot; title=&quot;What if the Placebo Effect Isn’t a Trick?&quot;&gt;What if the Placebo Effect Isn’t a Trick?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And after a quarter-century of hard work, they have abundant evidence to prove it. Give people a sugar pill, they have shown, and those patients — especially if they have one of the chronic, stress-related conditions that register the strongest placebo effects and if the treatment is delivered by someone in whom they have confidence — will improve. Tell someone a normal milkshake is a diet beverage, and his gut will respond as if the drink were low fat. Take athletes to the top of the Alps, put them on exercise machines and hook them to an oxygen tank, and they will perform better than when they are breathing room air — even if room air is all that’s in the tank. Wake a patient from surgery and tell him you’ve done an arthroscopic repair, and his knee gets better even if all you did was knock him out and put a couple of incisions in his skin. Give a drug a fancy name, and it works better than if you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You don’t even have to deceive the patients. You can hand a patient with irritable bowel syndrome a sugar pill, identify it as such and tell her that sugar pills are known to be effective when used as placebos, and she will get better, especially if you take the time to deliver that message with warmth and close attention. Depression, back pain, chemotherapy-related malaise, migraine, post-traumatic stress disorder: The list of conditions that respond to placebos — as well as they do to drugs, with some patients — is long and growing.&lt;/p&gt;

Wikipedia and other sites already do a fantastic job of detailing the story behind websites, apps, and everything else. This site focuses on observable changes over time. If you’re a longtime user of a certain product, there’s probably going to be some nostalgia as you look at all the previous iterations of it over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I used to DM during every BM. Then, one afternoon a few years ago, I slipped into a poop portal. Backpacking through remote wilderness in searing heat, I felt the telltale pang. Coffee, eggs, chorizo, and water were all rushing—screamingly—to the exits. At the nearest rest stop, I dashed into a bathroom so single-mindedly I didn’t turn on the lights and collapsed onto the toilet. The immediate release, shrouded as it was in shadow, was cosmic, like waking up from a nightmare, realizing it’s Christmas, I’m 5 years old, and can fly. Though I haven’t yet been able to recreate every condition, to this day I try to dump in total darkness: no lights, no phone, the gulf between mind and body quaked shut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Amazon’s home security company Ring has enlisted local police departments around the country to advertise its surveillance cameras in exchange for free Ring products and a “portal” that allows police to request footage from these cameras, a secret agreement obtained by Motherboard shows. The agreement also requires police to “keep the terms of this program confidential.”
[…]
People often buy and use Ring doorbell cameras under the premise that they’re making their individual homes safer. But these people aren’t just making choices for themselves. They’re consenting to surveilling everyone in their neighborhood and anyone who comes in the vicinity of their home, including friends and family, delivery workers, and anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Further entrenching automobile supremacy are laws that require landowners who build housing and office space to build housing for cars as well. In large part because of parking quotas, parking lots now cover more than a third of the land area of some U.S. cities; Houston is estimated to have 30 parking spaces for every resident. As the UCLA urban-planning professor Donald Shoup has written, this mismatch flows from legal mandates rather than market demand. Every employee who brings a car to the office essentially doubles the amount of space he takes up at work, and in urban areas his employer may be required by law to build him a $50,000 garage parking space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A good golf course is a great asset to the nation. Those who harangue against land being diverted from agriculture and used for golf have little sense of proportion. Comparing the small amount of land utilised for golf with the large amount devoted to agriculture, we get infinitely more value out of the former than the latter. We all eat too much. During the Great War the majority were all the fitter for being rationed and getting a smaller amount of food, but none of us get enough fresh air, pleasurable excitement, and exercise. Health and happiness are everything in this world.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Prisoners take apart beard trimmers or CD players to get at the tiny motor, which they can adapt to make the tattoo needle go up and down quickly enough.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The needle itself is often made from a metal guitar string split in two by holding it over an open flame until it snaps in half, creating a fine point. The springs inside gel pens can also flatten into needles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One former prisoner who now runs a tattoo shop said he used to make black ink by trapping soot in a milk carton placed over a burning pile of plastic razors or Bible pages. He would mix the leftover ash and soot with a bit of alcohol (for hygienic purposes).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This website replays the Apollo 11 mission as it happened, 50 years ago. It consists entirely of historical material, all timed to Ground Elapsed Time–the master mission clock. Footage of Mission Control, film shot by the astronauts, and television broadcasts transmitted from space and the surface of the Moon, have been painstakingly placed to the very moments they were shot during the mission, as has every photograph taken, and every word spoken.&lt;/p&gt;

[…]
When I taste things, I also hear music, mainly chords – sugar and desserts almost always in major key and chocolate and coffee are particularly complex sounds, with overtones and harmonics. I love broccoli and cauliflower which are a cycle of fifths. Sushi tastes like power chords on an acoustic guitar. Lemon meringue pie is a concoction of A major chords and inversions, 7ths and minors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everyone knew that the US Department of Justice and Attorney General Barr would release the Mueller Report as a PDF file.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In fact, it’s safe to say that AG Barr never considered delivering anything else. No one would have even suggested a Word file, or a set of TIFF images, or a website, or an XPS file, or EPUB, or plain text. It’s 2019, but it seems safe to say that they simply assumed they’d use PDF.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you are like most people, you simply assumed it would be a PDF as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On every swing a battle raged between his technical proficiency and mental fragility. He would stand over the ball, his mind jumbled with swing thoughts. His hands strangled the grip, his arms were knots of tension. The seconds would tick by, and he felt powerless to lift the club. Then the uncertainty would ebb just long enough to allow him to start his swing, and the resulting shot would be flawless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t understand any of this analysis so I’ll spoil it; It would take 454,159 Legos stacked one on top of the other to destroy the bottom brick. That is 2.7 miles of Legos…halfway up Everest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the unique perspective of Golden Bell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And the roars for him were unlike those even for Arnie and Jack. I think that’s because Tiger wasn’t adored like Arnie, and he wasn’t lionized like Jack. No there was something else about him, something more aspirational. I am not sure I can describe it — I am no poet, I am the subject of poetry — but as I understand it, Tiger offered to take the crowd to a place where golf had never gone. He was an astronaut. He hit shots no one had ever hit. He saw possibilities where others saw tree branches and double bogeys. He brought order to a disorderly game.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Anyway, that’s how I have heard it described.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Then, one day, something with Tiger Woods changed. One hears things, but I am not one to partake in rumors. But I could see that Tiger no longer commanded the game the way he had. The crowds still shouted for him, but their cheers were less confident and more nervous. He grew older. He seemed to have a different swing every time I saw him. And then, some years, he did not show up at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This human element of the game adds color but it comes at a high cost: too many mistakes. In 2018, MLB umpires, made 34,294 incorrect ball and strike calls for an average of 14 per game or 1.6 per inning. Many umpires well exceeded this number. Some of these flubbed calls were game changing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This newsletter is a collection of things I have found in the last month that I enjoyed, found interesting, or simply wanted to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow me more closely at &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.net&quot; title=&quot;Personal Website&quot;&gt;my personal website&lt;/a&gt; or if you or someone you know is looking to buy or sell a home, you can point them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.com&quot; title=&quot;Business Website &quot;&gt;my real estate website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;m68&quot;&gt;M68&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18263844/apple-iphone-prototype-m68-original-development-board-red&quot;&gt;An Exclusive Look at an Original iPhone Prototype&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Apple had developed the iPhone in secret over those two and a half years, and for many inside the company, the device had only been known by the codenames “M68” and “Purple 2.” Apple was focused on surprising everyone with the iPhone, and that meant that many of the engineers working on the original handset didn’t even know what it would eventually look like.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To achieve that level of secrecy, Apple created special prototype development boards that contained nearly all of the iPhone’s parts, spread out across a large circuit board. The Verge has obtained exclusive access to the original iPhone M68 prototype board from 2006 / 2007, thanks to Red M Sixty, a source that asked to remain anonymous. It’s the first time this board has been pictured publicly, and it provides a rare historical look at an important part of computing history, showing how Apple developed the original iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;80658175170943878571660636856403766975289505440883277824000000000000&quot;&gt;80658175170943878571660636856403766975289505440883277824000000000000&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://czep.net/weblog/52cards.html&quot;&gt;52 Cards Shuffled&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summarized:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Set a timer to count down 52! seconds (that’s 8.0658x1067 seconds).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stand on the equator, and take a step forward every billion years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you’ve circled the earth once, take a drop of water from the Pacific Ocean, and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the Pacific Ocean is empty, lay a sheet of paper down, refill the ocean and carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When your stack of paper reaches the sun, take a look at the timer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 3 left-most digits won’t have changed. 8.063x1067 seconds left to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat the whole process 1000 times to get 1/3 of the way through that time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.385x1067 seconds left to go. To kill that time you try something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shuffle a deck of cards, deal yourself 5 card poker hand every billion years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each time you get a royal flush, buy a lottery ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each time that ticket wins the jackpot, throw a grain of sand in the grand canyon&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the grand canyon’s full, take 1oz of rock off Mount Everest. Empty the canyon and start over again.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Everest has been leveled, check the timer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s barely any change. 5.364x1067 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The timer would run out sometime during your 255th time through the process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then the investigators had the program examine the likes of other Facebook users. If the software had as few as 10 [likes] for analysis, it was able to evaluate that person about as well as a co-worker did. Given 70 likes, the algorithm was about as accurate as a friend. With 300 [likes], it was more successful than the person’s spouse. Even more astonishing to the researchers, feeding likes into their program enabled them to predict whether someone suffered from depression or took drugs and even to infer what the individual studied in school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Aberdeen’s area of responsibility over the North Sea is the same size as the entire UK landmass, approximately 100,000² nautical miles. Most of this area is ‘uncontrolled’ Class G airspace, with a number of military Danger Areas; this makes the controlling environment complex and demanding.
[…]
Tricky conditions such as strong winds, fog in summer and snow in winter provide challenges to the team in Aberdeen, with high waves around the rigs and a phenomenon called ‘triggered lightning’ (where the movement of rotor blade generates electricity between them in certain weather conditions) also affect operations, making it one of the most challenging and interested places to be an air traffic controller anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For the past 10 years, street photographer Patrick Barr aka Tiger Hood has become a local legend known for bringing golf to the streets of NYC. It’s a game that requires only three items: a golf club, a newspaper-stuffed milk carton, and a crate. What was initially just a way for Barr to pass time has gained traction from major news outlets and celebrities on a global scale. However, street golf seems to overshadow his true passion… photography. Barr’s archive consists of thousands of mind blowing film photographs of NYC from the 1990’s to 2000’s. His goal was to preserve a time and place that he predicted would dissolve in the coming years. With his archive as evidence, he predicted correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This newsletter is a collection of things I have found in the last month that I enjoyed, found interesting, or simply wanted to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow me more closely at &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.net&quot; title=&quot;Personal Website&quot;&gt;my personal website&lt;/a&gt; or if you or someone you know is looking to buy or sell a home, you can point them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.com&quot; title=&quot;Business Website &quot;&gt;my real estate website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-my-brain-intact&quot;&gt;“Is my brain intact?”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nautil.us/issue/61/coordinates/the-strange-brain-of-the-worlds-greatest-solo-climber-rp&quot; title=&quot;The Strange Brain of the World’s Greatest Solo Climber&quot;&gt;The Strange Brain of the World’s Greatest Solo Climber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Honnold is twice as sensation-seeking as the average person, and fully 20 percent higher than the average high sensation seeker. The most likely explanation for his flatline amygdala activation in the scanner, Joseph says, is that the tasks she set for him simply were not strong enough tea.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Honnold also scores as exceedingly conscientious, associated with the ability to concentrate, remain focused on a task, and see things through. He also surveyed high in premeditation, his typical modus operandi, and very low in neuroticism, making him unlikely to ruminate over unlikely outcomes or risks that are impossible to manage. “If you don’t have any fear to begin with,” Honnold says, “there’s a lot less to control.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“He has the traits that enable him to be incredibly focused, and incredibly patient, but at the same time totally sensation seeking,” Joseph says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honnald’s most acclaimed climb is being the first free solo (climb without ropes) El Capitan. The documentary featuring this achievement, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/films/free-solo/&quot; title=&quot;Free Solo&quot;&gt;Free Solo&lt;/a&gt;, was recently nominated for an Oscar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie is a 97 minute stress test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;putt-putt&quot;&gt;Putt-Putt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thesandtrap.com/forums/topic/93352-putting-with-the-flagstick-in/&quot; title=&quot;Putting with the Flagstick In&quot;&gt;Analysis: Putting with the Flagstick In&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usga.org/content/usga/home-page/rules-hub/rules-modernization/major-changes/major-changes.html&quot; title=&quot;USGA's 2019 Rule Changes&quot;&gt;USGA’s 2019 Rule changes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usga.org/content/usga/home-page/rules-hub/rules-modernization/major-changes/ball-played-from-the-putting-green-hits-unattended-flagstick-in-hole.html&quot; title=&quot;There is no longer a penalty if a ball played from the putting green hits a flagstick left in the hole&quot;&gt;there is no longer a penalty if a ball played from the putting green hits a flagstick left in the hole&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR; You should leave the flagstick in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The flagstick slows the ball by a greater factor than it decreases the time the ball spends suspended over the hole.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Unless you have exceptional distance control, effective capture speed can remain about the same.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Hitting the ball more firmly allows for a larger margin of error. It also reduces the tendency of a slow-moving putt to “wobble” or be moved off-line due to imperfections.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Players, particularly poorer putters, leave a lot of putts from 6’ to 15’ short. This change would let them be more aggressive.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The situations where the flagstick should be removed (it leans too much, it’s moving around a lot in the wind) almost never occur.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The flagstick offers an aid - it gives the player yet another point or two at which to aim.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bryson DeChambeau, the most scientific player on tour (at least boastfully), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.golfdigest.com/story/bryson-dechambeau-says-hell-putt-with-the-pin-in-next-year-most-of-the-time-because-science&quot; title=&quot;says&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that he will almost always leave the flagstick in because of the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_restitution&quot; title=&quot;Coefficient of Restitution&quot;&gt;coefficient of restitution&lt;/a&gt;”. Good to know.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you about a specific day as a cable tech. I can’t tell you my first customer was a cat hoarder. I can tell you the details, sure. That I smeared Vicks on my lip to try to cover the stench of rugs and walls and upholstery soaked in cat piss. That I wore booties, not to protect the carpets from the mud on my boots but to keep the cat piss off my soles. I can tell you the problem with her cable service was that her cats chewed through the wiring. That I had to move a mummified cat behind the television to replace the jumper. That ammonia seeped into the polyester fibers of my itchy blue uniform, clung to the sweat in my hair. That the smell stuck to me through the next job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;People who are searching for good enough are not second-guessing themselves. When there’s any little imperfection, people who are searching for the best don’t say, “Well, the world has disappointed me.” They say, “I must have made a mistake.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I preferred the audio version to the written article, for what it’s worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When Charles Barkley’s mother, Charcey Glenn, passed away in June 2015, Barkley’s hometown of Leeds, Alabama, came to the funeral to pay respects. But there was also an unexpected guest.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Barkley’s friends couldn’t quite place him. He wasn’t a basketball player, he wasn’t a sports figure, and he wasn’t from Barkley’s hometown. Here’s what I can tell you about him: He wore striped, red polo shirts tucked into khaki shorts and got really excited about two-for-one deals. He was a commuter. He worked as a cat litter scientist in Muscatine, Iowa. In short, he was everyone’s suburban dad. More specifically, he was my dad.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“You know, it was obviously a very difficult time,” Barkley told me recently. “And the next thing I know, he shows up. Everybody’s like, ‘Who’s the Asian dude over there?’ I just started laughing. I said, ‘That’s my boy, Lin.’ They’re, like, ‘How do you know him?’ I said, ‘It’s a long story.’ “&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This newsletter is a collection of things I have found in the last month that I enjoyed, found interesting, or simply wanted to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow me more closely at &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.net&quot; title=&quot;Personal Website&quot;&gt;my personal website&lt;/a&gt; or if you or someone you know is looking to buy or sell a home, you can point them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.com&quot; title=&quot;Business Website &quot;&gt;my real estate website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;au-revoir-le-grand-k&quot;&gt;Au Revoir, Le Grand K&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/official-redefining-kilogram-units-measurement&quot;&gt;Mass of a Kilogram to be Redefined&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, every measurement of mass made anywhere on Earth is tied back to this one cylindrical object. Known as “Le Grand K,” the cylinder, cast in 1879, is kept carefully sequestered in a secure, controlled environment outside Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On May 20, 2019, Le Grand K will lose its special status, and the mass of a kilogram will be defined by a fundamental constant of nature known as the Planck constant. At the same time, other mainstays of the metric system will also be revamped: the ampere (the unit of electric current), the kelvin (the unit of temperature) and the mole (the unit for amount of substance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;one-two-ten&quot;&gt;One. Two. Ten!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/12/home-alone-gangster-movie&quot; title=&quot;Inside the Making of ​Home Alone​’s Fake Gangster Movie&quot;&gt;Inside the Making of Home Alone’s Fake Gangster Movie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Reeking of authenticity, &lt;em&gt;Angels with Filthy Souls&lt;/em&gt; is not just a uniquely persuasive parody. It’s the perfect movie-within-a-movie: a one-minute-and-20-second noir-in-a-nutshell that feels like a fleeting glimpse of a long-lost classic. Its dialogue is crisp, the characters and performances credible, the rapid escalation of its drama enthralling. Plus it culminates in not just the most memorable utterance in Home Alone but one of the great movie lines of all time: “Keep the change, ya filthy animal”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unintended-behaviors-of-ai&quot;&gt;Unintended Behaviors of AI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;https://claycarson.net/2018/01/01/january-2018/&quot; title=&quot;January's Newsletter&quot;&gt;January’s newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, Nick Bostrom, a philosopher at Oxford University, has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/22/artificial-intelligence-oxford_n_5689858.html&quot; title=&quot;Paperclip Thought Experiment&quot;&gt;thought experiment&lt;/a&gt; that goes…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Suppose we have an AI whose only goal is to make as many paper clips as possible. The AI will realize quickly that it would be much better if there were no humans because humans might decide to switch it off. Because if humans do so, there would be fewer paper clips. Also, human bodies contain a lot of atoms that could be made into paper clips. The future that the AI would be trying to gear towards would be one in which there were a lot of paper clips but no humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of Bostrom’s thought exercise came &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/plinz/status/985249543582355458&quot; title=&quot;Joscha Bach Tweet&quot;&gt;Joscha Bach’s&lt;/a&gt; Lebowski Theorem stating that, “No superintelligent AI is going to bother with a task that is harder than hacking its reward function.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vkrakovna.wordpress.com/2018/04/02/specification-gaming-examples-in-ai/&quot; title=&quot;Victoria Krakovna&quot;&gt;Victoria Krakovna&lt;/a&gt; has begun aggregating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vRPiprOaC3HsCf5Tuum8bRfzYUiKLRqJmbOoC-32JorNdfyTiRRsR7Ea5eWtvsWzuxo8bjOxCG84dAg/pubhtml&quot; title=&quot;AI Unintended Consequences&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of AI who have gamed their objective or reward system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;examples&quot;&gt;Examples:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Agent pauses the game indefinitely to avoid losing.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Agent kills itself at the end of level 1 to avoid losing in level 2.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“A robotic arm trained to slide a block to a target position on a table achieves the goal by moving the table itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“In an artificial life simulation where survival required energy but giving birth had no energy cost, one species evolved a sedentary lifestyle that consisted mostly of mating in order to produce new children which could be eaten (or used as mates to produce more edible children).”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“AI trained to classify skin lesions as potentially cancerous learns that lesions photographed next to a ruler are more likely to be malignant.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I remember one day I was running late for practice, so I was flying down the 405. All of a sudden, I look in the rearview, and I see the flashing lights. This unmarked police truck is right up on me. Tinted windows. Big heavy-duty truck. Woop-woop.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I knew I was speeding. So I pull over, and I roll the window down, and I’m reaching over into the glove compartment to get my papers ….&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;… Then I hear this voice. Big, booming voice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“WHERE YOU G’WAN, BOY?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’m like, Damn, they got the sergeant on me or something?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I turn to look out the window, and I can’t even see this dude’s face he’s so big. All I see is his chest.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“I SAID WHERE YOU G’WAN BOY?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Then he bends down and looks in the window.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Big, dumbass grin on his face.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It’s Shaq.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’m like, “Yo! I’m going to practice! You made me late!”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He don’t miss a beat. He taps side of my truck, turns around and says, “Don’t worry about it. I’ll pay your fine. Just holler at me.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’m looking in the rearview mirror, like, How the hell …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then there’s Stardew Valley—a humble, intimate farming adventure about the monotony of domestic life, in which you spend dozens of hours parenting cabbages. Eric was a team of one. It took him four and a half years to design, program, animate, draw, compose, record, and write everything in the game, working 12-hour days, seven days a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first played Stardew Valley all I wanted was to play it on an iPad. &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/app/stardew-valley/id1406710800&quot; title=&quot;Stardew Valley for iOS&quot;&gt;Stardew Valley for iOS&lt;/a&gt; was released in late October. If you do decide to give it a shot, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Getting_Started&quot; title=&quot;Stardew Valley Wiki&quot;&gt;Wiki&lt;/a&gt; is required reading as far as I am concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection&quot; title=&quot;Mercator Projection - Wikipedia&quot;&gt;Mercator projection&lt;/a&gt; is a cylindrical map projection presented by the Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569. It became the standard map projection for nautical navigation because of its ability to represent lines of constant course, known as rhumb lines or loxodromes, as straight segments that conserve the angles with the meridians. Although the linear scale is equal in all directions around any point, thus preserving the angles and the shapes of small objects (making it a conformal map projection), the Mercator projection distorts the size of objects as the latitude increases from the Equator to the poles, where the scale becomes infinite. So, for example, landmasses such as Greenland and Antarctica appear much larger than they actually are, relative to landmasses near the equator such as Central Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Affiliation with sports teams, it seems, is a contemporary form of tribalism. “Our sports heroes are our warriors,” Cialdini once remarked. And tribal affiliation, along with satisfying our need for a sense of belonging, produces another social pleasure that’s not so warm and fuzzy: the good vibes of walloping your opponent. It’s what Germans call schadenfreude, literally “harm-joy,” the pleasure derived from others’ misfortune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://melmagazine.com/an-oral-history-of-goldeneye-007-on-the-n64-129844f1c5ab&quot;&gt;An Oral History of ‘GoldenEye 007’ on the N64&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;GoldenEye 007 was originally planned to be a 2D, single-player side-scrolling game, much like Donkey Kong, another game that British developers Rare were producing at the time for the SNES. However, lead developer Martin Hollis suggested it be a 3D first-person shooter for the Nintendo 64, a system and technology that didn’t even fully exist yet. He got his way, and assembled a ragtag team of new-to-gaming developers to begin working on what was expected to be “just another film license” game — games that typically rode the movie’s fame, but didn’t prove to be smash hits, critically or commercially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just to cut to the chase…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Telstar 18, the design for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, is as close to a perfect sphere as you can get. It has subtle pimples and six thermally bonded panels designed to avoid knuckling, which is the characteristic bobbing and weaving movement when a ball is kicked without spin. All 32 teams have been able to play with it since November in preparation for the tournament, which runs from June 14 to July 15. But despite its similarities to the old ball, players have grumbled about the Telstar 18. Compared to the last few World Cup balls, the Telstar 18 is very similar to the ball used for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. It won’t fly quite as far down the pitch, and will wobble in the air a little differently, but aerodynamic testing suggests it will be more stable in the air overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have just ‘celebrated’ the 20 year anniversary of The Undertaker vs. Mankind in Hell in a Cell. I have known the phrase, “In 1998 The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell in a Cell.” as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-undertaker-threw-mankind-off-hell-in-a-cell&quot; title=&quot;meme&quot;&gt;meme&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;architectural-and-interiors-photographers&quot;&gt;Architectural and Interiors Photographers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve found myself going off the deep end of architectural and interiors photography in the last few weeks. Below are a few links to some work I’ve been admiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mpkelley.com/gallery/&quot;&gt;Mike Kelley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mattiasschlachet.com&quot;&gt;Mattias Schlachet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;zip-it&quot;&gt;Zip It…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/email/quartz-obsession/1264216/&quot; title=&quot;Zippers&quot;&gt;Zip it real good&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Don’t ever expect to see how zippers are made at YKK. Founded in 1934, Yoshida Kōgyō Kabushikigaisha is the world’s zipper kingpin, and it keeps its manufacturing secrets under lock and key. As John Balzar explains in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/05/news/mn-19744/3&quot; title=&quot;LA Times&quot;&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;, that’s partly because YKK makes everything—and we mean everything—on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“YKK smelts its own brass, concocts its own polyester, spins and twists its own thread, weaves and color-dyes cloth for its zipper tapes, forges and molds its scooped zipper teeth, extrudes the monofilament for coil zippers, hammers and paints the sliders, clamps the stops, attaches the dangley pulls in a thousand varieties, and even fabricates the cardboard boxes in which zippers are packaged. Naturally, YKK makes the machines that make the components.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Since YKK controls all aspects of its business, it’s widely viewed by design companies as the most dependable and consistent zipper brand on the planet. (Case in point: At &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/articles/business/branded/2012/04/ykk_zippers_why_so_many_designers_use_them_.html&quot; title=&quot;Slate&quot;&gt;Slate&lt;/a&gt;, Seth Stevenson points out that “When the Japanese earthquake hit in 2011 many supply chains were shredded, but YKK kept rolling along.”) For that reason alone, YKK is a major player in the (very niche) high-end zipper market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never knew there was so much to know about zippers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;are-you-my-friend&quot;&gt;Are you my friend?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ku.edu/2018/03/06/study-reveals-number-hours-it-takes-make-friend&quot;&gt;Study reveals how many hours it takes to make friends.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0265407518761225&quot; title=&quot;How many hours does it take to make a friend?&quot;&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, Associate Professor of Communication Studies Jeffrey Hall found that it takes roughly 50 hours of time together to move from mere acquaintance to casual friend, 90 hours to go from that stage to simple “friend” status and more than 200 hours before you can consider someone your close friend.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This means time spent hanging out, joking around, playing video games and the like. Hours spent working together just don’t count as much, Hall’s study found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hall’s colleagues developed an &lt;a href=&quot;https://mikewk.shinyapps.io/friendship/&quot; title=&quot;Interactive Friendship Tool&quot;&gt;”Interactive Friendship Tool”&lt;/a&gt; to guess whether someone is an acquaintance, casual friend, friend or close friend.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This newsletter is a collection of things I have found in the last month that I enjoyed, found interesting, or simply wanted to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow me more closely at &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.net&quot; title=&quot;Personal Website&quot;&gt;my personal website&lt;/a&gt; or if you or someone you know is looking to buy or sell a home, you can point them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.com&quot; title=&quot;Business Website &quot;&gt;my real estate website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A well-accepted theory of psychology, marketing, and other fields is that human language reflects personality, thinking style, social connections, and emotional states. The frequency with which we use certain categories of words can provide clues to these characteristics. Several researchers found that variations in word usage in writings such as blogs, essays, and tweets can predict aspects of personality.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;IBM conducted a set of studies to understand whether personality characteristics inferred from social media data can predict people’s behavior and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was 1977, and we were leaving a photography session on 23rd Street. Jacques Morali saw the big pink YMCA on 23rd and asked, “What is this YMCA, anyway? “And after laughing at his accent, we told him the Y was a place where you could go when you first came to New York when you didn’t have any money — you can stay there for very little. And of course, someone joked, “Yeah, but don’t bend over in the showers. “And Jacques, bless his heart, said, “I will write a song about this!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Frito-Lay had a formidable research complex near Dallas, where nearly 500 chemists, psychologists and technicians conducted research that cost up to $30 million a year, and the science corps focused intense amounts of resources on questions of crunch, mouth feel and aroma for each of these items. Their tools included a $40,000 device that simulated a chewing mouth to test and perfect the chips, discovering things like the perfect break point: people like a chip that snaps with about four pounds of pressure per square inch.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To get a better feel for their work, I called on Steven Witherly, a food scientist who wrote a fascinating guide for industry insiders titled, “Why Humans Like Junk Food.” I brought him two shopping bags filled with a variety of chips to taste. He zeroed right in on the Cheetos. “This,” Witherly said, “is one of the most marvelously constructed foods on the planet, in terms of pure pleasure.” He ticked off a dozen attributes of the Cheetos that make the brain say more. But the one he focused on most was the puff’s uncanny ability to melt in the mouth. “It’s called vanishing caloric density,” Witherly said. “If something melts down quickly, your brain thinks that there’s no calories in it… you can just keep eating it forever.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We deify willpower and self-control, and mock its absence. People who achieve through remarkable willpower are “strong” and “heroic.” People who need help or structure are “weak.” This is crazy—because few of us can accurately gauge or predict our willpower. We not only overestimate it, we chronically underestimate the power of triggers in our environment to lead us astray. Our environment is a magnificent willpower-reduction machine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As time ticked on, holes were further altered to address playability, agronomics, spectator convenience and, most recently, 21st-century club and ball technology. Our challenge was to graphically document every architectural change at Augusta National in a manner never attempted before. To do it, we enlisted the talents of computer artist Chris O’Riley to prepare a succession of detailed diagrams based upon our 30-plus years of research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are an insane number of people playing both &lt;a href=&quot;https://playbattlegrounds.com/main.pu&quot; title=&quot;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&quot;&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcgamesn.com/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/battlegrounds-sales-numbers&quot;&gt;over 30 million players&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/buy-now/battle-royale&quot; title=&quot;Fortnite&quot;&gt;Fortnite&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcgamesn.com/fortnite/fortnite-battle-royale-player-numbers&quot;&gt;over 45 million players&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both games are also pulling wild viewership numbers on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv&quot;&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. In February, Twitch streamed 65.44 million hours of Fortnite gameplay and 43.33 million hours of PUBG gameplay. 600,000 people watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/videos/238954097&quot; title=&quot;Drake and Ninja Stream&quot;&gt;Ninja stream Fortnite with Drake&lt;/a&gt;…at 3am…on a Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is widely agreed that Fortnite is a better game. Fortnite is a blast but it never feels high stakes. In PUBG I can hear my pulse. No, not my character’s pulse - my actual beating heart pounding in my ears.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“When the scammers started to hound Therrien, he hounded them right back. Obsessed with payback, he spent hundreds of hours investigating the dirty side of debt. By day he was still promoting ice cream brands and hiring models for liquor store tastings. But in his spare time, he was living out a revenge fantasy. He befriended loan sharks and blackmailed crooked collectors, getting them to divulge their suppliers, and then their suppliers above them. In method, Therrien was like a prosecutor flipping gangster underlings to get to lieutenants and then the boss. In spirit, he was a bit like Liam Neeson’s vigilante character in the movie Taken—using unflagging aggression to obtain scraps of information and reverse-engineer a criminal syndicate. Therrien didn’t punch anyone in the head, of course. He was simply unstoppable over the phone.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Friedman inserted a screw into the straw toward the top (see image). Then he wrapped dental floss around the paper, tracing grooves made by the inserted screw. Finally, he removed the screw, leaving a accordion-like ridge in the middle of the once-straight straw. Voila! he had created a straw that could bend around its grooves to reach a child’s face over the edge of a glass.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;HER birthday: must set plans in motion. Run a bath, put on cologne, set the table. High anxiety. Run down list: set watch again, put water in glasses, set flowers. Run to the window — phew! Watch her put a finger to the doorbell. Such joy! What timing! And just as the sun sets, too!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Thus does an evening beckon, full of pleasantry and promise. But as described here it notes events in a manner of considerable interest for the lexicographer. For scattered within the vocabulary of this 54-word drama are 11 uses of the three most complex verbs in the English language: “set,” “put” and “run.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the internet age, recall memory — the ability to spontaneously call information up in your mind — has become less necessary. It’s still good for bar trivia, or remembering your to-do list, but largely, Horvath says, what’s called recognition memory is more important. “So long as you know where that information is at and how to access it, then you don’t really need to recall it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Research has shown that the internet functions as a sort of externalized memory. “When people expect to have future access to information, they have lower rates of recall of the information itself,” as one study puts it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;By the same token, every human being has the freedom to change at any instant. Therefore, we can predict his future only within the large framework of a statistical survey referring to a whole group; the individual personality, however, remains essentially unpredictable. The basis for any predictions would be represented by biological, psychological or sociological conditions. Yet one of the main features of human existence is the capacity to rise above such conditions, to grow beyond them. Man is capable of changing the world for the better if possible, and of changing himself for the better if necessary.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This newsletter is a collection of things I have found in the last month that I enjoyed, found interesting, or simply wanted to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow me more closely at &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.net&quot; title=&quot;Personal Website&quot;&gt;my personal website&lt;/a&gt; or if you or someone you know is looking to buy or sell a home, you can point them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://claycarson.com&quot; title=&quot;Business Website &quot;&gt;my real estate website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prime-time&quot;&gt;Prime Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mersenne.org/primes/press/M77232917.html&quot; title=&quot;50th Known Mersenne Prime Discovered&quot;&gt;50th Known Mersenne Prime Discovered: 2^77,232,917-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The new prime number, also known as M77232917, is calculated by multiplying together 77,232,917 twos, and then subtracting one. &lt;strong&gt;It is nearly one million digits larger than the previous record prime number&lt;/strong&gt;, in a special class of extremely rare prime numbers known as Mersenne primes. It is only the 50th known Mersenne prime ever discovered, each increasingly difficult to find. Mersenne primes were named for the French monk Marin Mersenne, who studied these numbers more than 350 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trashed&quot;&gt;Trashed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/trashed-inside-the-deadly-world-of-private-garbage-collection&quot; title=&quot;Inside the Deadly World of Private Garbage Collection&quot;&gt;Inside the Deadly World of Private Garbage Collection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Waste and recycling work is the fifth most fatal job in America — far more deadly than serving as a police officer or a firefighter. Loggers have the highest fatality rate, followed by fishing workers, aircraft pilots and roofers. From the collection out on garbage trucks, to the processing at transfer stations and recycling centers, to the dumping at landfills, the waste industry averages about one worker fatality a week. Nationally, in 2016, 82 percent of waste-worker deaths occurred in the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Tribe-Homecoming-Belonging-Sebastian-Junger/dp/1455566381&quot; title=&quot;Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The public is often accused of being disconnected from its military, but frankly, it’s disconnected from just about everything. Farming, mineral extraction, gas and oil production, bulk cargo transport, logging, fishing, infrastructure construction—all the industries that keep the nation going are mostly unacknowledged by the people who depend on them most.
&lt;em&gt;- Sebastian Junger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-will-never-see-the-same&quot;&gt;You Will Never See the Same&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/01/when-your-eyes-move-so-do-your-eardrums/551237/&quot; title=&quot;When Your Eyes Move, So Do Your Eardrums&quot;&gt;When Your Eyes Move, So Do Your Eardrums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Without moving your head, look to your left. Now look to your right. Keep flicking your eyes back and forth, left and right.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Even if you managed to keep the rest of your body completely still, your eyeballs were not the only parts of your head that just moved. Your ears did, too. Specifically, your eardrums—the thin membranes inside each of your ears—wobbled. As your eyes flitted right, both eardrums bulged to the left, one inward and one outward. They then bounced back and forth a few times, before coming to a halt. When you looked left, they bulged to the right, and oscillated again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;They also found that the eardrums start to wobble about 10 milliseconds before the eyes. This suggests that the ears aren’t reacting to what’s happening in the eyes. Instead, Groh says, “the brain is saying: I am about to move the eyes; ears, get ready.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while we are on the subject of hearing, find out why &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wjzepx/sonic-tonic-stressweek2017&quot; title=&quot;Sonic Tonic&quot;&gt;nature sounds can help you sleep and relax&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As life evolved on Earth, living beings developed different sensory organs to guide them toward food, alert them to danger, and find their way around the world. Without these senses, we couldn’t have survived. But sometimes, these very senses can cause our minds to get over-stimulated. When there’s too much noise, for example, it can be really distressing, but we usually can’t just turn off our hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From an evolutionary standpoint, this is beneficial to us. If there’s some danger in our environment, we can act accordingly (or wake up, if we happen to be asleep). Sudden sounds jolt us into action, get our hearts pumping, and the adrenaline and cortisol soaring in our bodies so as to prepare us for fight or flight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But living in a stream of constant, jarring noises can be highly toxic. One of the biggest problems with urban soundscapes, according to Benfield, is that people think they’ve adjusted to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-way-the-world-ends-not-with-a-bang-but-a-paperclip&quot;&gt;The Way The World Ends: Not With A Bang But A Paperclip&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/the-way-the-world-ends-not-with-a-bang-but-a-paperclip/&quot; title=&quot;Wired&quot;&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt; takes a look at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html&quot; title=&quot;Paperclips&quot;&gt;Paperclips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a clicker game from  &lt;a href=&quot;http://gamecenter.nyu.edu/faculty/frank-lantz/&quot; title=&quot;Frank Lantz&quot;&gt;Frank Lantz&lt;/a&gt; based on speculations in Nick Bostrom’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/1501227742&quot; title=&quot;Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies&quot;&gt;Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/22/artificial-intelligence-oxford_n_5689858.html&quot; title=&quot;Huffington Post interview&quot;&gt;Huffington Post interview&lt;/a&gt;, Bostrom makes his point much more succinctly, albeit less thorough, than a game or his book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Suppose we have an AI whose only goal is to make as many paper clips as possible. The AI will realize quickly that it would be much better if there were no humans because humans might decide to switch it off. Because if humans do so, there would be fewer paper clips. Also, human bodies contain a lot of atoms that could be made into paper clips. The future that the AI would be trying to gear towards would be one in which there were a lot of paper clips but no humans.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Below I have included a list of the books I have read or listened to throughout 2017.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manson, Mark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Emotions are simply biological signals designed to nudge you in the direction of beneficial change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In other words, negative emotions are a call to action. When you feel them, it’s because you’re supposed to do something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The rare people who do become truly exceptional at something do so not because they believe they’re exceptional. On the contrary, they become amazing because they’re obsessed with improvement. And that obsession with improvement stems from an unerring belief that they are, in fact, not that great at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Remember, emotions are just feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is why people are often so afraid of success—for the exact same reason they’re afraid of failure: it threatens who they believe themselves to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have both some good news and some bad news for you: there is little that is unique or special about your problems. That’s why letting go is so liberating. There’s a kind of self-absorption that comes with fear based on an irrational certainty. When you assume that your plane is the one that’s going to crash, or that your project idea is the stupid one everyone is going to laugh at, or that you’re the one everyone is going to choose to mock or ignore, you’re implicitly telling yourself, “I’m the exception; I’m unlike everybody else; I’m different and special.” This is narcissism, pure and simple. You feel as though your problems deserve to be treated differently, that your problems have some unique math to them that doesn’t obey the laws of the physical universe. My recommendation: don’t be special; don’t be unique. Redefine your metrics in mundane and broad ways. Choose to measure yourself not as a rising star or an undiscovered genius. Choose to measure yourself not as some horrible victim or dismal failure. Instead, measure yourself by more mundane identities: a student, a partner, a friend, a creator. The narrower and rarer the identity you choose for yourself, the more everything will seem to threaten you. For that reason, define yourself in the simplest and most ordinary ways possible. This often means giving up some grandiose ideas about yourself: that you’re uniquely intelligent, or spectacularly talented, or intimidatingly attractive, or especially victimized in ways other people could never imagine. This means giving up your sense of entitlement and your belief that you’re somehow owed something by this world. This means giving up the supply of emotional highs that you’ve been sustaining yourself on for years. Like a junkie giving up the needle, you’re going to go through withdrawal when you start giving these things up. But you’ll come out the other side so much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If someone is better than you at something, then it’s likely because she has failed at it more than you have. If someone is worse than you, it’s likely because he hasn’t been through all of the painful learning experiences you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Learn to sustain the pain you’ve chosen. When you choose a new value, you are choosing to introduce a new form of pain into your life. Relish it. Savor it. Welcome it with open arms. Then act despite it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our culture today confuses great attention and great success, assuming them to be the same thing. But they are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-one-thing-the-surprisingly-simple-truth-behind-extraordinary-results&quot;&gt;The ONE Thing: The Surprisingly Simple Truth Behind Extraordinary Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keller, Gary; Papasan, Jay&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Extraordinary results are directly determined by how narrow you can make your focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Because extraordinary success is sequential, not simultaneous. What starts out linear becomes geometric. You do the right thing and then you do the next right thing. Over time it adds up, and the geometric potential of success is unleashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When everything feels urgent and important, everything seems equal. We become active and busy, but this doesn’t actually move us any closer to success. Activity is often unrelated to productivity, and busyness rarely takes care of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So when you see people who look like “disciplined” people, what you’re really seeing is people who’ve trained a handful of habits into their lives. This makes them seem “disciplined” when actually they’re not. No one is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Achievement and abundance show up because they’re the natural outcomes of doing the right things with no limits attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret to getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks and then starting on the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pick a direction, start marching down that path, and see how you like it. Time brings clarity and if you find you don’t like it, you can always change your mind. It’s your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One evening an elder Cherokee told his grandson about a battle that goes on inside all people. He said, “My son, the battle is between two wolves inside us. One is Fear. It carries anxiety, concern, uncertainty, hesitancy, indecision and inaction. The other is Faith. It brings calm, conviction, confidence, enthusiasm, decisiveness, excitement and action.” The grandson thought about it for a moment and then meekly asked his grandfather: “Which wolf wins?” The old Cherokee replied, “The one you feed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ancients resisted innovation in warfare because they feared it would rob the struggle of honor. King Agis was shown a new catapult, which could shoot a killing dart 200 yards. When he saw this, he wept. “Alas,” he said. “Valor is no more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Alexander’s party was trying to get through the busy street, but the yogis had their spot and they wouldn’t move. One of Alexander’s zealous young lieutenants took it upon himself to chase the holy men out of the king’s path. When one of the wise men resisted, the officer started verbally abusing him. Just then, Alexander came up. The lieutenant pointed to Alexander and said to the yogi, “This man has conquered the world! What have you accomplished?” The yogi looked up calmly and replied, “I have conquered the need to conquer the world.” At this, Alexander laughed with approval. He admired the naked wise men. “Could I be any man in the world other than myself,” he said, “I would be this man here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think the educational and psychological studies I mentioned are examples of what I would like to call cargo cult science. In the South Seas there is a cargo cult of people. During the war they saw airplanes land with lots of good materials, and they want the same thing to happen now. So they’ve arranged to make things like runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head like headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas—he’s the controller—and they wait for the airplanes to land. They’re doing everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked before. But it doesn’t work. No airplanes land. So I call these things cargo cult science, because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of scientific investigation, but they’re missing something essential, because the planes don’t land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;if-this-is-a-man-and-the-truce&quot;&gt;If This is a Man and The Truce&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Levi, Primo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sooner or later in life everyone discovers that perfect happiness is unrealizable, but there are few who pause to consider the antithesis: that perfect unhappiness is equally unattainable. The obstacles preventing the realization for both these extreme states are of the same nature: they derive from our human condition which is opposed to everything infinite. Our ever-insufficient knowledge of the future opposes it: and this is called, in the one instance, hope, and in the other, uncertainty of the following day. The certainty of death opposes it: for it places a limit on every joy, but also on every grief. The inevitable material cares oppose it: for as they poison every lasting happiness, they equally assiduously distract us from our misfortunes and make our consciousness of them intermittent and hence supportable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And one must take into account a definite cushioning effect exercising both by the law, and by the moral sense which constitutes a self-imposed law; for a country is considered the more civilized the more the wisdom and efficiency of its law hinder a weak man from becoming too weak or a powerful one too powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Self-doubt can be an ally. This is because it serves as an indicator of aspiration. It reflects love, love of something we dream of doing, and desire, desire to do it. If you find yourself asking yourself (and your friends), “Am I really a writer? Am I really an artist?” chances are you are. The counterfeit innovator is wildly self-confident. The real one is scared to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Your job is to collect good ideas. The more good ideas you collect, the more you can choose from to be influenced by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Instead, chew on one thinker—writer, artist, activist, role model—you really love. Study everything there is to know about that thinker. Then find three people that thinker loved, and find out everything about them. Repeat this as many times as you can. Climb up the tree as far as you can go. Once you build your tree, it’s time to start your own branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s not the book you start with, it’s the book that book leads you to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;essentialism-the-disciplined-pursuit-of-less&quot;&gt;Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;McKeown, Greg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The word priority came into the English language in the 1400s. It was singular. It meant the very first or prior thing. It stayed singular for the next five hundred years. Only in the 1900s did we pluralize the term and start talking about priorities. Illogically, we reasoned that by changing the word we could bend reality. Somehow we would now be able to have multiple “first” things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Essentialists spend as much time as possible exploring, listening, debating, questioning, and thinking. But their exploration is not an end in itself. The purpose of the exploration is to discern the vital few from the trivial many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What if we stopped celebrating being busy as a measurement of importance? What if instead we celebrated how much time we had spent listening, pondering, meditating, and enjoying time with the most important people in our lives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Tao of Warren Buffett, Mary Buffett and David Clark explain: “Warren decided early in his career it would be impossible for him to make hundreds of right investment decisions, so he decided that he would invest only in the businesses that he was absolutely sure of, and then bet heavily on them. He owes 90% of his wealth to just ten investments. Sometimes what you don’t do is just as important as what you do.” In short, he makes big bets on the essential few investment opportunities and says no to the many merely good ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To discern what is truly essential we need space to think, time to look and listen, permission to play, wisdom to sleep, and the discipline to apply highly selective criteria to the choices we make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we underinvest in ourselves, and by that I mean our minds, our bodies, and our spirits, we damage the very tool we need to make our highest contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In an interview about his book The Power of Habit Charles Duhigg said “in the last 15 years, as we’ve learned how habits work and how they can be changed, scientists have explained that every habit is made up of a cue, a routine, and a reward. The cue is a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine—the behavior itself—which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular habit is worth remembering for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tribe-on-homecoming-and-belonging&quot;&gt;Tribe: On Homecoming and Belonging&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Junger, Sebastian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What catastrophes seem to do—sometimes in the span of a few minutes—is turn back the clock on ten thousand years of social evolution. Self-interest gets subsumed into group interest because there is no survival outside group survival, and that creates a social bond that many people sorely miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Such public meaning is probably not generated by the kinds of formulaic phrases, such as “Thank you for your service,” that many Americans now feel compelled to offer soldiers and vets. Neither is it generated by honoring vets at sporting events, allowing them to board planes first, or giving them minor discounts at stores. If anything, these token acts only deepen the chasm between the military and civilian populations by highlighting the fact that some people serve their country but the vast majority don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The public is often accused of being disconnected from its military, but frankly it’s disconnected from just about everything. Farming, mineral extraction, gas and oil production, bulk cargo transport, logging, fishing, infrastructure construction—all the industries that keep the nation going are mostly unacknowledged by the people who depend on them most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One way to determine what is missing in day-to-day American life may be to examine what behaviors spontaneously arise when that life is disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Roger Federer as a Religious Experience</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/String-Theory&quot; title=&quot;Gates Notes&quot;&gt;Bill Gates recommends a book&lt;/a&gt; of compiled David Foster Wallace articles called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/String-Theory-Wallace-Library-Publication/dp/1598534807&quot; title=&quot;String Theory&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;String Theory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Wondering if I’d enjoy the book, I stumbled upon this 11 year old article that examines an already experienced Federer whose career we still enthralled with today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The metaphysical explanation is that Roger Federer is one of those rare, preternatural athletes who appear to be exempt, at least in part, from certain physical laws. Good analogues here include Michael Jordan, who could not only jump inhumanly high but actually hang there a beat or two longer than gravity allows, and Muhammad Ali, who really could “float” across the canvas and land two or three jabs in the clock-time required for one. There are probably a half-dozen other examples since 1960. And Federer is of this type — a type that one could call genius, or mutant, or avatar. He is never hurried or off-balance. The approaching ball hangs, for him, a split-second longer than it ought to. His movements are lithe rather than athletic. Like Ali, Jordan, Maradona, and Gretzky, he seems both less and more substantial than the men he faces. Particularly in the all-white that Wimbledon enjoys getting away with still requiring, he looks like what he may well (I think) be: a creature whose body is both flesh and, somehow, light.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Shoe Dogs: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike</title>

  &lt;p&gt;Onitsuka asked what we thought [new shoe] should be called. Bowerman liked “Aztec,” in homage to the 1968 Olympics, which were being held in Mexico City. I liked that, too. Fine, Onitsuka said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Aztec was born. And then Adidas threatened to sue. Adidas already had a new shoe named the “Azteca Gold,” a track spike they were planning to introduce at the same Olympics. No one had ever heard of it, but that didn’t stop Adidas from kicking up a fuss.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Aggravated, I drove up the mountain to Bowerman’s house to talk it all over. We sat on the wide porch, looking down at the river. It sparkled that day like a silver shoelace. He took off his ball cap, put it on again, rubbed his face. “Who was that guy who kicked the shit out of the Aztecs?” he asked. “Cortez,” I said. He grunted. “Okay. Let’s call it the Cortez.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We asked over 150 Americans to draw 10 famous logos from memory as accurately as they could. Based on more than 1,500 drawings created over a period of 80 hours, the results reveal that, far from being stamped perfectly in our collective memory, these ubiquitous emblems largely exist as fuzzy visions in our mind’s eye. One in 5 people thinks the Foot Locker referee wears a hat (he doesn’t), and nearly half of people believe the Starbucks mermaid does not wear a crown (she does). That only scratches the surface of what our study found out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At the Ryder Cup every little detail becomes an obsession, from the pleats in the golfers’ pants to how the pin positions favor the collective ball flights of the home team. No minutia is insignificant … unless you’re Dustin Johnson and his brother-caddie, Austin, golf’s most laconic characters. During last year’s event at Hazeltine, Dustin faced a sloping mid-length putt that plainly had two or three feet of right-to-left break. After conferring with his brother, he started his ball a yard left of the hole, missing the putt by at least six feet. Had the tension short-circuited his stroke or perhaps clouded his vision, even though this was just a practice round? In his soft South Carolina drawl, Dustin offered his caddie a different explanation: “Awwwww, man, I had the [green-reading] book upside down.”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Magnificent Supercell Thunderstorm Timelapse</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ingredient based explanation for supercell thunderstorms cites moisture, wind shear, instability and lift as the reasons for their formation. I prefer to focus on the big picture. Supercell thunderstorms are a manifestation of nature’s attempt to correct an extreme imbalance. The ever ongoing effort to reach equilibrium, or viscosity, is what drives all of our weather, and the force with which the atmosphere tries to correct this imbalance is proportional to the gradient. In other words, the more extreme the imbalance, the more extreme the storm.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>This Is the Best Section in Every MLB Stadium if You Want to Catch a Home Run Ball</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A study by SeatGeek — in collaboration with ESPN — does just that: it combines seat locations with where home run balls land to determine where fans should sit if they want to catch a home run ball. To determine if a home run was “catchable,” SeatGeek overlaid data from ESPN’s Home Run Tracker with their custom seating charts to figure out an approximate location of where each ball landed. Stadiums that have spots where fans are not sitting weren’t included in the catchable total. SeatGeak, which sells tickets to sports and entertainment venues, then created a measure to determine what sections will give you the best chances of catching a ball for the lowest average ticket price.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At the end of the original film, Rebel ships fly along the Death Star trench in an attempt to blow up the space station. Look at the photo of the Death Star at the top of this post: can you point to the trench that Luke and the Rebels flew down to fire upon the exhaust port that would ultimately destroy the space station?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nearly everybody points at the equatorial trench of the Death Star. I asked dozens of die-hard fans, including many co-workers at Industrial Light &amp;amp; Magic, and nearly every single person pointed to the equatorial trench. If you asked me, I would also have said the equatorial trench.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I have a rule that has helped me a lot in life, particularly in my education: If there is a book I am interested in, I buy it. Regardless of the cost. Regardless of whether I have a stack of other things to read. Regardless of whether I have any sort of certainty about whether it’s any good. If I want it, I buy it. And when I buy it, I don’t care how much I spent on it or how rare it might be. I treat it just like every other book (which means marking up and writing in it).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Say, SEAL,” I say. “What would you do if there was an intruder in the house?” Slowly SEAL turns and looks at me. He holds me with an even, unemotional stare. Then he turns back to the TV without answering my question.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“No, really,” I say. “What would you do?” He shakes his head slowly. “I think you know what I’d do,” he says to the TV. “Tell me.” “I would protect the primary.” “What’s the primary?” “That’s the million-dollar question,” he says. “What is your primary, Jesse? What would hurt you the most to lose? This big-screen TV? Those gold record awards you own? Jewelry? Cash? What do you hold most dear?” “No,” I say. “None of that.” “Well?” he asks. “My wife and my son.” “Exactly, Jesse,” he says. “They’re your primary, and as long as I’m in this house they’re my primary too. You asked me what I would do. I would protect my primary at any cost. And unfortunately for you, you’re my third option.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The need to be better than, more than, recognized for, far past any reasonable utility— that’s ego. It’s the sense of superiority and certainty that exceeds the bounds of confidence and talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Research shows that while goal visualization is important, after a certain point our mind begins to confuse it with actual progress. The same goes for verbalization. Even talking aloud to ourselves while we work through difficult problems has been shown to significantly decrease insight and breakthroughs. After spending so much time thinking, explaining, and talking about a task, we start to feel that we’ve gotten closer to achieving it. Or worse, when things get tough, we feel we can toss the whole project aside because we’ve given it our best try, although of course we haven’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There is no excuse for not getting your education, and because the information we have before us is so vast, there is no excuse for ever ending that process either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Passion typically masks a weakness. Its breathlessness and impetuousness and franticness are poor substitutes for discipline, for mastery, for strength and purpose and perseverance. You need to be able to spot this in others and in yourself, because while the origins of passion may be earnest and good, its effects are comical and then monstrous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The question to ask, when you feel pride, then, is this: What am I missing right now that a more humble person might see?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I once asked a car-crash victim what it had felt like to be in a smashup. She said her eeriest memory was how one second the car was her friend, working for her, its contours designed to fit her body perfectly, everything smooth and sleek and luxurious, and then a blink of an eye later it had become a jagged weapon of torture— like she was inside an iron maiden. Her friend had become her worst enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And then Adidas threatened to sue. Adidas already had a new shoe named the “Azteca Gold,” a track spike they were planning to introduce at the same Olympics. No one had ever heard of it, but that didn’t stop Adidas from kicking up a fuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Aggravated, I drove up the mountain to Bowerman’s house to talk it all over. We sat on the wide porch, looking down at the river. It sparkled that day like a silver shoelace. He took off his ball cap, put it on again, rubbed his face. “Who was that guy who kicked the shit out of the Aztecs?” he asked. “Cortez,” I said. He grunted. “Okay. Let’s call it the Cortez.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When we do the work for itself alone, our pursuit of a career (or a living or fame or wealth or notoriety) turns into something else, something loftier and nobler, which we may never even have thought about or aspired to at the beginning. It turns into a practice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’m not going to go all Miss Manners on your ass and get into the social intricacies and delicate situations that surround thank-you note writing, as I was taught that a solid thank-you note will transcend all complicated situations—and I have seen no evidence to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There is a six-point formula to the proper thank-you: Learn it, know it, memorize it, and it will never fail you.&lt;/p&gt;

Trump is vulgarity unbounded, a knowledge-free national leader who will not only set markets tumbling but will strike fear into the hearts of the vulnerable, the weak, and, above all, the many varieties of Other whom he has so deeply insulted.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you fly, you’ve almost certainly found yourself packed into a Boeing 737. This workhorse of commercial aviation accounts for one of every three commercial flights, and there are around 2,000 of them in the air at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Every one of those planes rolled out of Boeing’s Renton Production Facility, where workers build a 737 in just nine days. The factory, near Seattle, pump them out at the rate of 42 per month, and Boeing claims the 1.1-million-square-foot facility is most efficient airplane factory in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Boeing faces fierce competition from arch rival Airbus. The 737 is the best-selling jet ever, with more than 9,000 delivered since its introduction in 1967, but the Airbus A320 is no slouch. The company has delivered about 6,700 of them since the airliner entered service in 1984.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To escape the long arm of American justice, the man responsible for the largest national security breach in U.S. history retained a Canadian lawyer in Hong Kong who hatched a plan that included a visit to the UN sub-office where the North Carolina native applied for refugee status to avoid extradition to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Fearing the media would surround and follow Snowden — making it easier for the Hong Kong authorities to arrest the one-time Central Intelligence Agency analyst on behalf of the U.S. — his lawyers made him virtually disappear for two weeks from June 10 to June 23, 2013, before he emerged on an Aeroflot airplane bound for Moscow, where he remains stranded today in self-imposed exile.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It’s the kind of job where you can’t just wear 10 different hats, you have to make the hats yourself. So you’re juggling constant projects and design work and construction work and repair work. You show up in the morning and you have to make sure that the whole theme park is safe—all the LEGO models are intact, there’s nothing broken, nothing’s going to fall down. And from there we’ll start to work on any repairs that they need done, or we’ll work on designing new models using computer software or using pencil and paper, or just building it from bricks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the day we’ll start building those models, and the design process is really either up to us or up to other LEGO Master Model Builders at other LEGOLAND parks. We share designs all the time, we’ll share construction and things like that. So it’s different depending on every single project, and every single project has a story behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The beauty of nature is sometimes found in the profound ‘intelligence’ it exudes. Perennials, which includes trees, must protect itself in order to get through the harsh, freezing temperatures of winter. If trees did not shed their leaves, their soft vegetation would certainly freeze during winter time, damaging and no doubt killing the tree.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In order to cope with the gruling winter temperatures, trees slowly close off the veins that carry water and nutrients to and from the leaves with a layer of new cells that form at the base of the leaf stem, protecting the limbs and body of the tree. Once the process of new cell creation is complete, water and nutrients no longer flow to and fro from the leaf – this enable the leaf to die and weaken at the stem, eventually falling gracefully to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This isn’t just jingoistic chirping about the enemy. In some cases, it’s Americans critiquing Americans, or Europeans burying Europeans: “It started with slightly dodgy mechanics,” said one, “and it has developed into a full-blown mental problem.” Another player’s weakness is highlighted: “Over a bunker to a tight flag is his worst nightmare. It’s not pretty.” And this: “He’s well capable of giving up. … If he’s not in the mood, he’s just not in the mood.”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Secret History of Tiger Woods</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//link/2016/04/21/the-secret-history-of-tiger-woods.html"/>
   <updated>2016-04-21T11:52:15-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/link/2016/04/21/the-secret-history-of-tiger-woods</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Outside of the golf course, it really seems that Tiger felt most comfortable using his superstar status to train with Navy SEALS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Eventually, Woods learned how to clear a room, working corners and figuring out lanes of fire, doing something only a handful of civilians are ever allowed to do: run through mock gun battles with actual Navy SEALs. “He can move through the house,” says Ed Hiner, a retired SEAL who helped oversee training during the time and wrote a book called First, Fast, Fearless. “He’s not freaking out. You escalate it. You start shooting and then you start blowing s— up. A lot of people freak out. It’s too loud, it’s too crazy. He did well.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At one point, Marshall put him through a combat stress shooting course, making him carry a 30-pound ammunition box, do overhead presses with it, do pushups and run up a hill, with shooting mixed in. Tiger struggled with slowing his heart rate down enough to hit the targets, but he attacked the course.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“He went all out,” Marshall said. “He just f—ing went all out.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Marshall got his golf clubs at one point and asked Tiger to sign his TaylorMade bag. Tiger refused, sheepishly, saying he couldn’t sign a competing brand. So Marshall challenged him to a driving contest for the signature. Both Marshall and Brown confirmed what happened next: Tiger grinned and agreed. Some other guys gathered around a raised area overlooking the shooting range. Marshall went first and hit a solid drive, around 260 or 270 yards. Tiger looked at him and teed up a ball, gripping the TaylorMade driver.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Then he got down on his knees.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;He swung the club like a baseball bat and crushed one out past Marshall’s drive. Tiger started laughing, and then all the SEALs started laughing, and eventually Marshall was laughing too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Well, I can just shoot you now and you can die,” Marshall joked, “or you can run and die tired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Woods held a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GWJuniorTour/status/723275985894957056&quot;&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GWJuniorTour/status/723277404169461760&quot;&gt;Golfweek Junior Tour&lt;/a&gt; and is seen hitting golf balls publicly since &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TigerWoods/status/702492113188032512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;late February&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The BYU team also learned that a “low angle of attack” produces the least splash. When pee hits the porcelain at a 90 degree angle, the splashback is terrible. But when the urine simulator aimed low—imagine hitting just above the drain of the urinal—the splash was more modest and not angled back at the urinator. This is also a good reason to aim sideways rather than straight at the urinal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The ghosts in Pac-Man are among some of the most enduring enemies in video game history, thanks in part to their surprisingly difficult to predict movements which make the game a constant challenge for new and seasoned players alike. However, as it turns out, the ghost’s movements are defined by a deceptively simple set of algorithms thought up by the game’s designer, Toru Iwatani.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On this day, I was testing a new lens and camera body. When I approached the Lion from the observation area his head was almost completely submerged below the water’s surface. As I raised my camera and composed the shot, Luke simultaneously raised his head out of the water in my direction. As I began to fire off continuous shots the sound of my shutter focused Luke’s attention on me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Through the lens, I felt his stare; it was powerful enough to make me stop shooting, and for that moment, time seemed to pause and nothing else existed but this massive imposing lion intensely staring back at me as if to my soul.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I truly felt amazed and minuscule by the power of this animal. I watched the rest of his intrigue and facial expression not through my lens, but peering around the side of my camera still holding it as if I were shooting. It was the first time anything has ever made me stop shooting. It was such an unforgettable moment, something I am lucky to have been a part of. I will never forget.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How Mosquitoes Survive Raindrops</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000//link/2015/07/03/how-mosquitoes-survive-raindrops.html"/>
   <updated>2015-07-03T13:38:18-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/link/2015/07/03/how-mosquitoes-survive-raindrops</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A study says a mosquito being hit by a raindrop is roughly the equivalent of a human being whacked by a school bus, the typical bus being about 50 times the mass of a person. And worse, when it’s raining hard, each mosquito should expect to get smacked, grazed, or shoved by a raindrop every 25 seconds. So rain should be dangerous to a mosquito. And yet (you probably haven’t looked, but trust me), when it’s raining those little pains in the neck are happily darting about in the air, getting banged—and they don’t seem to care. Raindrops, for some reason, don’t bother them. […]&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In most direct hits, Hu and colleagues write, the insect is carried five to 20 body lengths downward, and then, rather gracefully—maybe helped by a dense layer of wax-coated, water-repellent hairs—gets up and “walks” to the side, then steps off into the air, almost like a schoolchild getting off of a bus (albeit a fast-moving bus hurtling toward its doom). It does this almost matter-of-factly, like it’s no big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Back in the day, we had to create everything by hand,” Nintendo designer Takashi Tezuka said in a video released as part of Nintendo’s E3 announcement Tuesday. Every square of land, question-mark block and Goomba had to be hand-drawn and colored on graph paper. When they were happy with the design, they sent it off to a developer to code. Fixing errors or making changes was tricky. Shigeru Miyamoto, Mario’s creator, said whiting out mistakes was too messy, so they overlaid opaque tracing paper on top of the level being drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Auschwitz I and nearby Auschwitz II-Birkenau were the extermination camps where an estimated 1.1 million people—mostly Jews from across Europe, but also political opponents, prisoners of war, homosexuals, and Roma—were killed in gas chambers or by systematic starvation, forced labor, disease, or medical experiments. About 200,000 camp inmates survived the ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To ensure that the film’s twist was as surprising as possible, Bryan Singer persuaded several of the lead actors that their characters were really Keyzer Söze. ‘I remember when we screened it for the company of actors,’ recalled Kevin Spacey, ‘Gabriel Byrne was stunned that he wasn’t Keyser Söze. Went out into the parking lot and had an argument with Bryan Singer. For a half an hour.’&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The team tasked with repairing the artwork had their work cut out for them. The assailant had left a massive triangular tear in the middle of the canvas, and some of the paint had been so badly pulverized that it couldn’t be reattached. Over the course of two years, conservators worked carefully to repair the painting and restore it to its original condition. A true labor of love, the project was recently documented on the museum website and has been reproduced here with its permission. Take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve had a blog of some sorts off and on since late 2006. I never really wrote much except for a few ‘tip’ type posts for Mac OS X. A couple of years after that I started tweaking things on my site and figured out how to do &lt;a href=&quot;daringfireball.net&quot;&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/a&gt; style link posts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My blog has always been hosted on Wordpress - until now. I am now using &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; to create a Static Blog that also happens to be free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site will host links that I find interesting as well as a few articles about thoughts I feel are worth sharing. You will find some posts and links dated prior to December 18, 2014. These are just a handful of posts from my old site that I felt were still worth sharing and they gave me a bit of an Archive so the site isn’t too bare.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On January 13, 1999, a girl named Hae Min Lee, a senior at Woodlawn High School in Baltimore County, Maryland, disappeared. A month later, her body turned up in a city park. She’d been strangled. Her 17-year-old ex-boyfriend, Adnan Syed, was arrested for the crime, and within a year, he was convicted and sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison. The case against him was largely based on the story of one witness, Adnan’s friend Jay, who testified that he helped Adnan bury Hae’s body. But Adnan has always maintained he had nothing to do with Hae’s death. Some people believe he’s telling the truth. Many others don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

Keep and exaggerate the bone-splitting hits; lose the killjoy penalties and injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Buy Food: The Psychology of the Supermarket</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Think about your usual supermarket routine. Chances are, if your market is designed like the majority in the U.S., you start shopping at the right side of the store and work your way around the outer rim of the supermarket—with occasional forays into certain aisles, but generally sticking to a counterclockwise route till you get to the register.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Now you may wonder, Why do I always choose to go that way?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The answer is, you don’t. Whoever designed the supermarket chose that path for you, and for a particular reason: About nine in ten people are right-handed, and a counterclockwise route makes it easier for right-handed people to put stuff in their carts.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Italian automaker founded in 1963 by feisty Ferrari hater Ferruccio Lamborghini built a long line of swoopy exotics that demanded passionate, dedicated drivers — with an equally passionate and dedicated mechanic on speed dial. Several ownership changes over the years, including an ill-fated union with Chrysler in the 1980s didn’t help the cause. Lamborghinis inspired lust, but consistency of build and reliability proved elusive.&lt;/p&gt;

Modern engineering has created an efficient way to dispense toilet paper, but it has left orientation up to consumer. In determining which is best, there are numerous variables, statistics, and principles of mechanics to take into account. And simple efficiency is not the only concern: for many, TP orientation is a matter of identity, lifestyle, and passion. Let us walk you through this timeless and enduring debate.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;It’s not a real Wiffle ball game unless you can break a window. Or windows.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Skinny yellow bats only…&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Yes you can throw your super-awesome curve ball. But throw it fat and slow over the plate. Like a 2011 Astro.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Aria opened on Dec. 16 last year, marketing itself as a high-tech alternative to Vegas’s more traditional resorts, with a data and communication system driven by 283 individual telecom rooms and a broadband antennae network covering 140 million square feet. And while the technology brings many high-tech luxuries to visitors—omnipresent wireless connectivity, 3D monitors and smart touchscreen interfaces—it also crosses into potential Big Brother territory (even by Vegas standards). Here is a close look at some of Aria’s biggest technological advances and the issues they raise.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When president Obama and two-thirds of the world’s leaders gather in New York City, it is up to the U.S. Secret Service to keep them all safe. Granted unprecedented access, our author tells the story of how the agency pulls off the most complicated security event of the year, from counter-surveillance to counter-assault, hotel booking to event scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;For a White House speechwriter, there is a conflict in the State of the Union address. It’s the speech that gets all the attention, where the president lays out his legislative agenda for the year ahead. But as far as poetry, arc and theme, it can also be the clunkiest.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Cracking The Credit Card Code</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There’s hardly a more prominant financial product in America today than the almighty credit card. Nearly everybody has at least one — almost 80% of consumers in 2008, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston – and many use it on a daily basis. Without a doubt, there are also those consumers who know their credit card numbers by heart (makes online shopping and booking travel so much easier, if anything). But how many of you know what those numbers really mean? Contrary to what you may think, they aren’t random.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Barrack Obama’s ‘O’ logo could be found everywhere throughout the election season. it is a design that I myself absolutely loved and had many times wondered, how it came to be. In my Communication Graphics class, we look at logos, typography, etc. So my eyes had been expanding to take notice of designing well-thought-out logos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York Times, has an interesting &lt;a href=&quot;http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/the-o-in-obama&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with Sol Sender, a graphic designer that worked on the logo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“At the end of 2006, Mode, a motion design studio in Chicago, approached Sol Sender, a graphic designer, to create a logo for Barack Obama’s presidential campaign. The resulting “O” became one of the most recognizable political logos in recent history. I spoke with Mr. Sender a few days after the election to discuss the evolution of his design.”&lt;/p&gt;
