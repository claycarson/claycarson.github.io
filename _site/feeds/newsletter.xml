<blockquote>
  <p>It’s not difficult to piece it together: With a video camera rolling, Richard would launch the balloon and freak out. He’d call the FAA and get the balloon tracked. There’d be a tearful reunion when Falcon emerged from the basement, where he’d been told to hide. Richard would call back and say his son wasn’t in the basket. They’d make sure the Fort Collins newspaper knew about the stray saucer and the drama behind it. The story might go nationwide. With publicity in full force and a recording of every moment, networks would fight over the Heenes’ story.</p>

  <p>Except Falcon didn’t hide where he was told to. He hid in the garage attic, not in the basement. He played with his cars and he fell asleep. The FAA said Richard needed to call 911. Deputies showed up. Neighbors began searching for Falcon. And then that silvery balloon was careening across our television screens. That’s why Mayumi’s reunion with Falcon was so believable: For a few hours, she and Richard honestly worried their son had been swept away.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 2004, winner Rustam Kasimdzhanov walked away from the six-game world championship having lost 17 pounds. In October 2018, Polar, a U.S.-based company that tracks heart rates, monitored chess players during a tournament and found that 21-year-old Russian grandmaster Mikhail Antipov had burned 560 calories in two hours of sitting and playing chess – or roughly what Roger Federer would burn in an hour of singles tennis.</p>

<h2 id="a-case-of-the-mondays">A Case of the Monday’s</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.golf.com/news/features/2019/08/14/ryan-french-unearthing-triumphs-tragedies-monday-qualifier-life/" title="Meet the man unearthing the triumphs (and tragedies) of Monday-qualifier life">Meet the Man Unearthing the Triumphs (and Tragedies) of Monday-Qualifier Life</a></p>

<p>Every Monday the PGA Tour holds a “small” tournament to get into the week’s “big” tournament. Four spots are up for grabs and there are often over 100 vagabonding golfers trying to play their way in.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I think golf is thought of as so elitist, epically pro golf — private jets and big money and handing out gloves — so I don’t think people knew this side of it existed,” French says. “They know minor-league baseball because everyone’s been to a minor-league baseball game. It’s organized. Monday qualifying is just so fractured. I don’t think people knew it existed, at least your casual golf fan didn’t. They didn’t realize there were people grinding out there sleeping in cars, and I think that’s the human interest of it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My favorites of French’s tweets are the <a href="https://twitter.com/acaseofthegolf1/status/1163104881454014466">tweets</a> that <a href="https://twitter.com/acaseofthegolf1/status/1152708850048471041">summarize</a> the <a href="https://twitter.com/acaseofthegolf1/status/1157062316871114752">level</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/acaseofthegolf1/status/1162323389069111297">play</a> so <a href="https://twitter.com/acaseofthegolf1/status/1162417675894759424">simply</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/magazine/placebo-effect-medicine.html" title="What if the Placebo Effect Isn’t a Trick?">What if the Placebo Effect Isn’t a Trick?</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And after a quarter-century of hard work, they have abundant evidence to prove it. Give people a sugar pill, they have shown, and those patients — especially if they have one of the chronic, stress-related conditions that register the strongest placebo effects and if the treatment is delivered by someone in whom they have confidence — will improve. Tell someone a normal milkshake is a diet beverage, and his gut will respond as if the drink were low fat. Take athletes to the top of the Alps, put them on exercise machines and hook them to an oxygen tank, and they will perform better than when they are breathing room air — even if room air is all that’s in the tank. Wake a patient from surgery and tell him you’ve done an arthroscopic repair, and his knee gets better even if all you did was knock him out and put a couple of incisions in his skin. Give a drug a fancy name, and it works better than if you don’t.</p>

  <p>You don’t even have to deceive the patients. You can hand a patient with irritable bowel syndrome a sugar pill, identify it as such and tell her that sugar pills are known to be effective when used as placebos, and she will get better, especially if you take the time to deliver that message with warmth and close attention. Depression, back pain, chemotherapy-related malaise, migraine, post-traumatic stress disorder: The list of conditions that respond to placebos — as well as they do to drugs, with some patients — is long and growing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.versionmuseum.com">Version Museum</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Much like walking through a real-life museum, Version Museum aims to illustrate the visual, tangible elements of various versions of technology, rather than just the written history behind it. Wikipedia and other sites already do a fantastic job of detailing the story behind websites, apps, and everything else. This site focuses on observable changes over time. If you’re a longtime user of a certain product, there’s probably going to be some nostalgia as you look at all the previous iterations of it over the years.</p>

<h2 id="the-crapture">“The (C)Rapture”</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>I used to DM during every BM. Then, one afternoon a few years ago, I slipped into a poop portal. Backpacking through remote wilderness in searing heat, I felt the telltale pang. Coffee, eggs, chorizo, and water were all rushing—screamingly—to the exits. At the nearest rest stop, I dashed into a bathroom so single-mindedly I didn’t turn on the lights and collapsed onto the toilet. The immediate release, shrouded as it was in shadow, was cosmic, like waking up from a nightmare, realizing it’s Christmas, I’m 5 years old, and can fly. Though I haven’t yet been able to recreate every condition, to this day I try to dump in total darkness: no lights, no phone, the gulf between mind and body quaked shut.</p>

<h2 id="ring-ring">Ring, Ring</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mb88za/amazon-requires-police-to-shill-surveillance-cameras-in-secret-agreement?xyz" title="Amazon Requires Police to Shill Surveillance Cameras in Secret Agreement">Amazon Requires Police to Shill Surveillance Cameras in Secret Agreement</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Amazon’s home security company Ring has enlisted local police departments around the country to advertise its surveillance cameras in exchange for free Ring products and a “portal” that allows police to request footage from these cameras, a secret agreement obtained by Motherboard shows. The agreement also requires police to “keep the terms of this program confidential.”
[…]
People often buy and use Ring doorbell cameras under the premise that they’re making their individual homes safer. But these people aren’t just making choices for themselves. They’re consenting to surveilling everyone in their neighborhood and anyone who comes in the vicinity of their home, including friends and family, delivery workers, and anyone else.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Further entrenching automobile supremacy are laws that require landowners who build housing and office space to build housing for cars as well. In large part because of parking quotas, parking lots now cover more than a third of the land area of some U.S. cities; Houston is estimated to have 30 parking spaces for every resident. As the UCLA urban-planning professor Donald Shoup has written, this mismatch flows from legal mandates rather than market demand. Every employee who brings a car to the office essentially doubles the amount of space he takes up at work, and in urban areas his employer may be required by law to build him a $50,000 garage parking space.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A good golf course is a great asset to the nation. Those who harangue against land being diverted from agriculture and used for golf have little sense of proportion. Comparing the small amount of land utilised for golf with the large amount devoted to agriculture, we get infinitely more value out of the former than the latter. We all eat too much. During the Great War the majority were all the fitter for being rationed and getting a smaller amount of food, but none of us get enough fresh air, pleasurable excitement, and exercise. Health and happiness are everything in this world.
<em>- Dr. Alister MacKenzie</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prisoners take apart beard trimmers or CD players to get at the tiny motor, which they can adapt to make the tattoo needle go up and down quickly enough.</p>

  <p>The needle itself is often made from a metal guitar string split in two by holding it over an open flame until it snaps in half, creating a fine point. The springs inside gel pens can also flatten into needles.</p>

  <p>One former prisoner who now runs a tattoo shop said he used to make black ink by trapping soot in a milk carton placed over a burning pile of plastic razors or Bible pages. He would mix the leftover ash and soot with a bit of alcohol (for hygienic purposes).</p>

Footage of Mission Control, film shot by the astronauts, and television broadcasts transmitted from space and the surface of the Moon, have been painstakingly placed to the very moments they were shot during the mission, as has every photograph taken, and every word spoken.</p>

  <p>That car horn beeps an F major chord, this kettle’s in A flat, some bedside lights get thrown out because they are out of tune with other appliances…bath taps squeak in E, this person sneezes in E flat. That printer’s in D mostly. The microwave is in the same key as the washing machine.
[…]
When I taste things, I also hear music, mainly chords – sugar and desserts almost always in major key and chocolate and coffee are particularly complex sounds, with overtones and harmonics. I love broccoli and cauliflower which are a cycle of fifths. Sushi tastes like power chords on an acoustic guitar. Lemon meringue pie is a concoction of A major chords and inversions, 7ths and minors.</p>

  <p>On every swing a battle raged between his technical proficiency and mental fragility. He would stand over the ball, his mind jumbled with swing thoughts. His hands strangled the grip, his arms were knots of tension. The seconds would tick by, and he felt powerless to lift the club. Then the uncertainty would ebb just long enough to allow him to start his swing, and the resulting shot would be flawless.</p>

<p>From the unique perspective of Golden Bell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And the roars for him were unlike those even for Arnie and Jack. I think that’s because Tiger wasn’t adored like Arnie, and he wasn’t lionized like Jack. No there was something else about him, something more aspirational. I am not sure I can describe it — I am no poet, I am the subject of poetry — but as I understand it, Tiger offered to take the crowd to a place where golf had never gone. He was an astronaut. He hit shots no one had ever hit. He saw possibilities where others saw tree branches and double bogeys. He brought order to a disorderly game.</p>

  <p>Anyway, that’s how I have heard it described.</p>

  <p>Then, one day, something with Tiger Woods changed. One hears things, but I am not one to partake in rumors. But I could see that Tiger no longer commanded the game the way he had. The crowds still shouted for him, but their cheers were less confident and more nervous. He grew older. He seemed to have a different swing every time I saw him. And then, some years, he did not show up at all.</p>

  <p>This human element of the game adds color but it comes at a high cost: too many mistakes. In 2018, MLB umpires, made 34,294 incorrect ball and strike calls for an average of 14 per game or 1.6 per inning. Many umpires well exceeded this number. Some of these flubbed calls were game changing.</p>

  <p>Apple had developed the iPhone in secret over those two and a half years, and for many inside the company, the device had only been known by the codenames “M68” and “Purple 2.” Apple was focused on surprising everyone with the iPhone, and that meant that many of the engineers working on the original handset didn’t even know what it would eventually look like.</p>

  <p>To achieve that level of secrecy, Apple created special prototype development boards that contained nearly all of the iPhone’s parts, spread out across a large circuit board. The Verge has obtained exclusive access to the original iPhone M68 prototype board from 2006 / 2007, thanks to Red M Sixty, a source that asked to remain anonymous. It’s the first time this board has been pictured publicly, and it provides a rare historical look at an important part of computing history, showing how Apple developed the original iPhone.</p>

<p>Summarized:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Set a timer to count down 52! seconds (that’s 8.0658x1067 seconds).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stand on the equator, and take a step forward every billion years.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you’ve circled the earth once, take a drop of water from the Pacific Ocean, and repeat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Pacific Ocean is empty, lay a sheet of paper down, refill the ocean and carry on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When your stack of paper reaches the sun, take a look at the timer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The 3 left-most digits won’t have changed. 8.063x1067 seconds left to go.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Repeat the whole process 1000 times to get 1/3 of the way through that time.</li>
</ul>

<p>5.385x1067 seconds left to go. To kill that time you try something else.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Shuffle a deck of cards, deal yourself 5 card poker hand every billion years.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each time you get a royal flush, buy a lottery ticket.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each time that ticket wins the jackpot, throw a grain of sand in the grand canyon</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the grand canyon’s full, take 1oz of rock off Mount Everest. Empty the canyon and start over again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When Everest has been leveled, check the timer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There’s barely any change. 5.364x1067 seconds.</p>

<p><strong>The timer would run out sometime during your 255th time through the process.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then the investigators had the program examine the likes of other Facebook users. If the software had as few as 10 [likes] for analysis, it was able to evaluate that person about as well as a co-worker did. Given 70 likes, the algorithm was about as accurate as a friend. With 300 [likes], it was more successful than the person’s spouse. Even more astonishing to the researchers, feeding likes into their program enabled them to predict whether someone suffered from depression or took drugs and even to infer what the individual studied in school.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aberdeen’s area of responsibility over the North Sea is the same size as the entire UK landmass, approximately 100,000² nautical miles. Most of this area is ‘uncontrolled’ Class G airspace, with a number of military Danger Areas; this makes the controlling environment complex and demanding.
[…]
Tricky conditions such as strong winds, fog in summer and snow in winter provide challenges to the team in Aberdeen, with high waves around the rigs and a phenomenon called ‘triggered lightning’ (where the movement of rotor blade generates electricity between them in certain weather conditions) also affect operations, making it one of the most challenging and interested places to be an air traffic controller anywhere in the world.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the past 10 years, street photographer Patrick Barr aka Tiger Hood has become a local legend known for bringing golf to the streets of NYC. It’s a game that requires only three items: a golf club, a newspaper-stuffed milk carton, and a crate. What was initially just a way for Barr to pass time has gained traction from major news outlets and celebrities on a global scale. However, street golf seems to overshadow his true passion… photography. Barr’s archive consists of thousands of mind blowing film photographs of NYC from the 1990’s to 2000’s. His goal was to preserve a time and place that he predicted would dissolve in the coming years. With his archive as evidence, he predicted correctly.</p>

  <p>Honnold is twice as sensation-seeking as the average person, and fully 20 percent higher than the average high sensation seeker. The most likely explanation for his flatline amygdala activation in the scanner, Joseph says, is that the tasks she set for him simply were not strong enough tea.</p>

  <p>Honnold also scores as exceedingly conscientious, associated with the ability to concentrate, remain focused on a task, and see things through. He also surveyed high in premeditation, his typical modus operandi, and very low in neuroticism, making him unlikely to ruminate over unlikely outcomes or risks that are impossible to manage. “If you don’t have any fear to begin with,” Honnold says, “there’s a lot less to control.”</p>

  <p>“He has the traits that enable him to be incredibly focused, and incredibly patient, but at the same time totally sensation seeking,” Joseph says.</p>

<h2 id="putt-putt">Putt-Putt</h2>

<p><a href="https://thesandtrap.com/forums/topic/93352-putting-with-the-flagstick-in/" title="Putting with the Flagstick In">Analysis: Putting with the Flagstick In</a></p>

<p>TLDR; You should leave the flagstick in.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>The flagstick slows the ball by a greater factor than it decreases the time the ball spends suspended over the hole.</li>
    <li>Unless you have exceptional distance control, effective capture speed can remain about the same.</li>
    <li>Hitting the ball more firmly allows for a larger margin of error. It also reduces the tendency of a slow-moving putt to “wobble” or be moved off-line due to imperfections.</li>
    <li>Players, particularly poorer putters, leave a lot of putts from 6’ to 15’ short. This change would let them be more aggressive.</li>
    <li>The situations where the flagstick should be removed (it leans too much, it’s moving around a lot in the wind) almost never occur.</li>
    <li>The flagstick offers an aid - it gives the player yet another point or two at which to aim.</li>

That I smeared Vicks on my lip to try to cover the stench of rugs and walls and upholstery soaked in cat piss. That I wore booties, not to protect the carpets from the mud on my boots but to keep the cat piss off my soles. I can tell you the problem with her cable service was that her cats chewed through the wiring. That I had to move a mummified cat behind the television to replace the jumper. That ammonia seeped into the polyester fibers of my itchy blue uniform, clung to the sweat in my hair. That the smell stuck to me through the next job.</p>

<p>I preferred the audio version to the written article, for what it’s worth.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When Charles Barkley’s mother, Charcey Glenn, passed away in June 2015, Barkley’s hometown of Leeds, Alabama, came to the funeral to pay respects. But there was also an unexpected guest.</p>

  <p>Barkley’s friends couldn’t quite place him. He wasn’t a basketball player, he wasn’t a sports figure, and he wasn’t from Barkley’s hometown. Here’s what I can tell you about him: He wore striped, red polo shirts tucked into khaki shorts and got really excited about two-for-one deals. He was a commuter. He worked as a cat litter scientist in Muscatine, Iowa. In short, he was everyone’s suburban dad. More specifically, he was my dad.</p>

  <p>“You know, it was obviously a very difficult time,” Barkley told me recently. “And the next thing I know, he shows up. Everybody’s like, ‘Who’s the Asian dude over there?’ I just started laughing. I said, ‘That’s my boy, Lin.’ They’re, like, ‘How do you know him?’ I said, ‘It’s a long story.’ “</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/official-redefining-kilogram-units-measurement">Mass of a Kilogram to be Redefined</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oddly enough, every measurement of mass made anywhere on Earth is tied back to this one cylindrical object. Known as “Le Grand K,” the cylinder, cast in 1879, is kept carefully sequestered in a secure, controlled environment outside Paris.</p>

  <p>[…]</p>

  <p>On May 20, 2019, Le Grand K will lose its special status, and the mass of a kilogram will be defined by a fundamental constant of nature known as the Planck constant. At the same time, other mainstays of the metric system will also be revamped: the ampere (the unit of electric current), the kelvin (the unit of temperature) and the mole (the unit for amount of substance).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reeking of authenticity, <em>Angels with Filthy Souls</em> is not just a uniquely persuasive parody. It’s the perfect movie-within-a-movie: a one-minute-and-20-second noir-in-a-nutshell that feels like a fleeting glimpse of a long-lost classic. Its dialogue is crisp, the characters and performances credible, the rapid escalation of its drama enthralling.

<p>Mentioned in <a href="https://claycarson.net/2018/01/01/january-2018/" title="January's Newsletter">January’s newsletter</a>, Nick Bostrom, a philosopher at Oxford University, has a <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/22/artificial-intelligence-oxford_n_5689858.html" title="Paperclip Thought Experiment">thought experiment</a> that goes…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose we have an AI whose only goal is to make as many paper clips as possible. The AI will realize quickly that it would be much better if there were no humans because humans might decide to switch it off. Because if humans do so, there would be fewer paper clips. Also, human bodies contain a lot of atoms that could be made into paper clips. The future that the AI would be trying to gear towards would be one in which there were a lot of paper clips but no humans.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I remember one day I was running late for practice, so I was flying down the 405. All of a sudden, I look in the rearview, and I see the flashing lights. This unmarked police truck is right up on me. Tinted windows. Big heavy-duty truck. Woop-woop.</p>

  <p>I knew I was speeding. So I pull over, and I roll the window down, and I’m reaching over into the glove compartment to get my papers ….</p>

  <p>… Then I hear this voice. Big, booming voice.</p>

  <p>“WHERE YOU G’WAN, BOY?”</p>

  <p>I’m like, Damn, they got the sergeant on me or something?</p>

  <p>I turn to look out the window, and I can’t even see this dude’s face he’s so big. All I see is his chest.</p>

  <p>“I SAID WHERE YOU G’WAN BOY?”</p>

  <p>Then he bends down and looks in the window.</p>

  <p>Big, dumbass grin on his face.</p>

  <p>It’s Shaq.</p>

  <p>I’m like, “Yo! I’m going to practice! You made me late!”</p>

  <p>He don’t miss a beat. He taps side of my truck, turns around and says, “Don’t worry about it. I’ll pay your fine. Just holler at me.”</p>

  <p>I’m looking in the rearview mirror, like, How the hell …</p>

  <p>Then there’s Stardew Valley—a humble, intimate farming adventure about the monotony of domestic life, in which you spend dozens of hours parenting cabbages. Eric was a team of one. It took him four and a half years to design, program, animate, draw, compose, record, and write everything in the game, working 12-hour days, seven days a week.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection" title="Mercator Projection - Wikipedia">Mercator projection</a> is a cylindrical map projection presented by the Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569. It became the standard map projection for nautical navigation because of its ability to represent lines of constant course, known as rhumb lines or loxodromes, as straight segments that conserve the angles with the meridians. Although the linear scale is equal in all directions around any point, thus preserving the angles and the shapes of small objects (making it a conformal map projection), the Mercator projection distorts the size of objects as the latitude increases from the Equator to the poles, where the scale becomes infinite. So, for example, landmasses such as Greenland and Antarctica appear much larger than they actually are, relative to landmasses near the equator such as Central Africa.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Affiliation with sports teams, it seems, is a contemporary form of tribalism. “Our sports heroes are our warriors,” Cialdini once remarked. And tribal affiliation, along with satisfying our need for a sense of belonging, produces another social pleasure that’s not so warm and fuzzy: the good vibes of walloping your opponent. It’s what Germans call schadenfreude, literally “harm-joy,” the pleasure derived from others’ misfortune.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GoldenEye 007 was originally planned to be a 2D, single-player side-scrolling game, much like Donkey Kong, another game that British developers Rare were producing at the time for the SNES. However, lead developer Martin Hollis suggested it be a 3D first-person shooter for the Nintendo 64, a system and technology that didn’t even fully exist yet. He got his way, and assembled a ragtag team of new-to-gaming developers to begin working on what was expected to be “just another film license” game — games that typically rode the movie’s fame, but didn’t prove to be smash hits, critically or commercially.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Telstar 18, the design for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, is as close to a perfect sphere as you can get. It has subtle pimples and six thermally bonded panels designed to avoid knuckling, which is the characteristic bobbing and weaving movement when a ball is kicked without spin. All 32 teams have been able to play with it since November in preparation for the tournament, which runs from June 14 to July 15. But despite its similarities to the old ball, players have grumbled about the Telstar 18. Compared to the last few World Cup balls, the Telstar 18 is very similar to the ball used for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. It won’t fly quite as far down the pitch, and will wobble in the air a little differently, but aerodynamic testing suggests it will be more stable in the air overall.</p>

<p><a href="https://qz.com/email/quartz-obsession/1264216/" title="Zippers">Zip it real good</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t ever expect to see how zippers are made at YKK. Founded in 1934, Yoshida Kōgyō Kabushikigaisha is the world’s zipper kingpin, and it keeps its manufacturing secrets under lock and key. As John Balzar explains in the <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/05/news/mn-19744/3" title="LA Times">Los Angeles Times</a>, that’s partly because YKK makes everything—and we mean everything—on its own.</p>

  <p>“YKK smelts its own brass, concocts its own polyester, spins and twists its own thread, weaves and color-dyes cloth for its zipper tapes, forges and molds its scooped zipper teeth, extrudes the monofilament for coil zippers, hammers and paints the sliders, clamps the stops, attaches the dangley pulls in a thousand varieties, and even fabricates the cardboard boxes in which zippers are packaged. Naturally, YKK makes the machines that make the components.”</p>

  <p>Since YKK controls all aspects of its business, it’s widely viewed by design companies as the most dependable and consistent zipper brand on the planet. (Case in point: At <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/branded/2012/04/ykk_zippers_why_so_many_designers_use_them_.html" title="Slate">Slate</a>, Seth Stevenson points out that “When the Japanese earthquake hit in 2011 many supply chains were shredded, but YKK kept rolling along.”) For that reason alone, YKK is a major player in the (very niche) high-end zipper market.</p>

  <p>This means time spent hanging out, joking around, playing video games and the like. Hours spent working together just don’t count as much, Hall’s study found.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A well-accepted theory of psychology, marketing, and other fields is that human language reflects personality, thinking style, social connections, and emotional states. The frequency with which we use certain categories of words can provide clues to these characteristics. Several researchers found that variations in word usage in writings such as blogs, essays, and tweets can predict aspects of personality.</p>

  <p>IBM conducted a set of studies to understand whether personality characteristics inferred from social media data can predict people’s behavior and preferences.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was 1977, and we were leaving a photography session on 23rd Street. Jacques Morali saw the big pink YMCA on 23rd and asked, “What is this YMCA, anyway? “And after laughing at his accent, we told him the Y was a place where you could go when you first came to New York when you didn’t have any money — you can stay there for very little. And of course, someone joked, “Yeah, but don’t bend over in the showers. “And Jacques, bless his heart, said, “I will write a song about this!”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Frito-Lay had a formidable research complex near Dallas, where nearly 500 chemists, psychologists and technicians conducted research that cost up to $30 million a year, and the science corps focused intense amounts of resources on questions of crunch, mouth feel and aroma for each of these items. Their tools included a $40,000 device that simulated a chewing mouth to test and perfect the chips, discovering things like the perfect break point: people like a chip that snaps with about four pounds of pressure per square inch.</p>

  <p>To get a better feel for their work, I called on Steven Witherly, a food scientist who wrote a fascinating guide for industry insiders titled, “Why Humans Like Junk Food.” I brought him two shopping bags filled with a variety of chips to taste. He zeroed right in on the Cheetos. “This,” Witherly said, “is one of the most marvelously constructed foods on the planet, in terms of pure pleasure.” He ticked off a dozen attributes of the Cheetos that make the brain say more. But the one he focused on most was the puff’s uncanny ability to melt in the mouth. “It’s called vanishing caloric density,” Witherly said. “If something melts down quickly, your brain thinks that there’s no calories in it… you can just keep eating it forever.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We deify willpower and self-control, and mock its absence. People who achieve through remarkable willpower are “strong” and “heroic.” People who need help or structure are “weak.” This is crazy—because few of us can accurately gauge or predict our willpower. We not only overestimate it, we chronically underestimate the power of triggers in our environment to lead us astray. Our environment is a magnificent willpower-reduction machine.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When the scammers started to hound Therrien, he hounded them right back. Obsessed with payback, he spent hundreds of hours investigating the dirty side of debt. By day he was still promoting ice cream brands and hiring models for liquor store tastings. But in his spare time, he was living out a revenge fantasy. He befriended loan sharks and blackmailed crooked collectors, getting them to divulge their suppliers, and then their suppliers above them. In method, Therrien was like a prosecutor flipping gangster underlings to get to lieutenants and then the boss. In spirit, he was a bit like Liam Neeson’s vigilante character in the movie Taken—using unflagging aggression to obtain scraps of information and reverse-engineer a criminal syndicate. Therrien didn’t punch anyone in the head, of course. He was simply unstoppable over the phone.”</p>

  <p>Friedman inserted a screw into the straw toward the top (see image). Then he wrapped dental floss around the paper, tracing grooves made by the inserted screw.

Voila! he had created a straw that could bend around its grooves to reach a child’s face over the edge of a glass.</p>

  <p>Thus does an evening beckon, full of pleasantry and promise. But as described here it notes events in a manner of considerable interest for the lexicographer.

  <p>In the internet age, recall memory — the ability to spontaneously call information up in your mind — has become less necessary. It’s still good for bar trivia, or remembering your to-do list, but largely, Horvath says, what’s called recognition memory is more important. “So long as you know where that information is at and how to access it, then you don’t really need to recall it,” he says.</p>

  <p>Research has shown that the internet functions as a sort of externalized memory. “When people expect to have future access to information, they have lower rates of recall of the information itself,” as one study puts it.</p>

<h3 id="mans-search-for-meaning">Man’s Search for Meaning</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment.</p>

  <p>By the same token, every human being has the freedom to change at any instant. Therefore, we can predict his future only within the large framework of a statistical survey referring to a whole group; the individual personality, however, remains essentially unpredictable. The basis for any predictions would be represented by biological, psychological or sociological conditions. Yet one of the main features of human existence is the capacity to rise above such conditions, to grow beyond them. Man is capable of changing the world for the better if possible, and of changing himself for the better if necessary.

  <p>Waste and recycling work is the fifth most fatal job in America — far more deadly than serving as a police officer or a firefighter.

From the collection out on garbage trucks, to the processing at transfer stations and recycling centers, to the dumping at landfills, the waste industry averages about one worker fatality a week. Nationally, in 2016, 82 percent of waste-worker deaths occurred in the private sector.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Without moving your head, look to your left. Now look to your right. Keep flicking your eyes back and forth, left and right.</p>

  <p>Even if you managed to keep the rest of your body completely still, your eyeballs were not the only parts of your head that just moved. Your ears did, too. Specifically, your eardrums—the thin membranes inside each of your ears—wobbled. As your eyes flitted right, both eardrums bulged to the left, one inward and one outward. They then bounced back and forth a few times, before coming to a halt. When you looked left, they bulged to the right, and oscillated again.</p>

  <p>[…]</p>

  <p>They also found that the eardrums start to wobble about 10 milliseconds before the eyes. This suggests that the ears aren’t reacting to what’s happening in the eyes. Instead, Groh says, “the brain is saying: I am about to move the eyes; ears, get ready.”</p>

<p>And while we are on the subject of hearing, find out why <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wjzepx/sonic-tonic-stressweek2017" title="Sonic Tonic">nature sounds can help you sleep and relax</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As life evolved on Earth, living beings developed different sensory organs to guide them toward food, alert them to danger, and find their way around the world. Without these senses, we couldn’t have survived. But sometimes, these very senses can cause our minds to get over-stimulated. When there’s too much noise, for example, it can be really distressing, but we usually can’t just turn off our hearing.</p>

  <p>From an evolutionary standpoint, this is beneficial to us. If there’s some danger in our environment, we can act accordingly (or wake up, if we happen to be asleep). Sudden sounds jolt us into action, get our hearts pumping, and the adrenaline and cortisol soaring in our bodies so as to prepare us for fight or flight.</p>

  <p>But living in a stream of constant, jarring noises can be highly toxic. One of the biggest problems with urban soundscapes, according to Benfield, is that people think they’ve adjusted to them.</p>

<h2 id="the-way-the-world-ends-not-with-a-bang-but-a-paperclip">The Way The World Ends: Not With A Bang But A Paperclip</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-way-the-world-ends-not-with-a-bang-but-a-paperclip/" title="Wired">Wired</a> takes a look at <em><a href="http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html" title="Paperclips">Paperclips</a></em>, a clicker game from  <a href="http://gamecenter.nyu.edu/faculty/frank-lantz/" title="Frank Lantz">Frank Lantz</a> based on speculations in Nick Bostrom’s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/1501227742" title="Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies">Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies</a></em>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/22/artificial-intelligence-oxford_n_5689858.html" title="Huffington Post interview">Huffington Post interview</a>, Bostrom makes his point much more succinctly, albeit less thorough, than a game or his book:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose we have an AI whose only goal is to make as many paper clips as possible. The AI will realize quickly that it would be much better if there were no humans because humans might decide to switch it off. Because if humans do so, there would be fewer paper clips. Also, human bodies contain a lot of atoms that could be made into paper clips. The future that the AI would be trying to gear towards would be one in which there were a lot of paper clips but no humans.</p>

<p>Plant Earth II has been added to <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80195377" title="Planet Earth II">Netflix</a>. Just as interesting as the action on screen is the action behind the camera. Early last year, Vox went <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/2/17/14600648/planet-earth-2-premiere-iguanas-snakes-clip" title="Snake Island chase">behind the scenes</a> to show how the famous ‘Snake Island’ chase was filmed.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/04/first-ten-.html" title="Seth Godin">Seth Godin</a> quote from Tim Ferris’ book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers/dp/1328683788" title="Tools of Titans">Tools of Titans</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘First, Ten,’ and it is a simple theory of marketing that says: tell ten people, show ten people, share it with ten people; ten people who already trust you and already like you. If they don’t tell anybody else, it’s not that good and you should start over. If they do tell other people, you’re on your way.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suppose my hope is that 10 of you might share this first issue as a way of showing me you have enjoyed it.</p>
