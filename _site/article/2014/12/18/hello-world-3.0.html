<p>I’ve had a blog of some sorts off and on since late 2006. I never really wrote much except for a few ‘tip’ type posts for Mac OS X. A couple of years after that I started tweaking things on my site and figured out how to do <a href="daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a> style link posts on <a href="https://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>.</p>

<p>My blog has always been hosted on Wordpress - until now. I am now using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to create a Static Blog that also happens to be free.</p>

<p>This site will host links that I find interesting as well as a few articles about thoughts I feel are worth sharing. You will find some posts and links dated prior to December 18, 2014. These are just a handful of posts from my old site that I felt were still worth sharing and they gave me a bit of an Archive so the site isn’t too bare.</p>

      <p>Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory […] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your project’s page or blog right here from GitHub. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
