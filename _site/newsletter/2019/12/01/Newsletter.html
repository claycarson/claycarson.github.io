<blockquote>
  <p>Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace…In ancient days, men looked at stars and saw their heroes in the constellations. In modern times, we do much the same, but our heroes are epic men of flesh and blood.</p>

<p>The MIT Center for Advanced Virtuality has taken audio and video of Nixon and <a href="https://moondisaster.org">created a fake film</a> of William Safire’s speech in the event of an Apollo 11 disaster.</p>

<h2 id="need-tickets-need-tickets">“Need tickets?” “Need tickets.”</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.sbnation.com/2019/10/9/20876265/ticket-scalping-world-cup-olympics-final-four" title="Sinners, Scalpers and the Search for God: One man’s descent into the underworld of sports">Sinners, Scalpers and the Search for God: One man’s descent into the underworld of sports</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fans who needed tickets stood out. We called them “straights” because they stand straight up in a crowd protecting the cash they’re unused to carrying, hands stuck in their pockets, and you could make a few thousand dollars in a couple of hours if you knew how to spot them. The game was to sell your tickets for as much cash as the straights could cough up.</p>

  <p>I had 30 tickets left with 20 minutes to kickoff. If I didn’t sell them they’d be worthless — deadwood. But with undercovers swarming the stadium, the risk of arrest swelled with every sale. Ticket scalping in Brazil carried a multi-year prison sentence, and I couldn’t speak Portuguese, so I had to be careful. Avoiding capture meant closing deals quickly and moving every five minutes. These were techniques my mentors taught me on street corners, outside the track at the Kentucky Derby, in the parking lots bordering the Masters, the hotel lobbies by the Super Bowl.</p>
