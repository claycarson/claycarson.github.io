<p>Outside of the golf course, it really seems that Tiger felt most comfortable using his superstar status to train with Navy SEALS.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eventually, Woods learned how to clear a room, working corners and figuring out lanes of fire, doing something only a handful of civilians are ever allowed to do: run through mock gun battles with actual Navy SEALs. “He can move through the house,” says Ed Hiner, a retired SEAL who helped oversee training during the time and wrote a book called First, Fast, Fearless. “He’s not freaking out. You escalate it. You start shooting and then you start blowing s— up. A lot of people freak out. It’s too loud, it’s too crazy. He did well.”</p>

  <p>At one point, Marshall put him through a combat stress shooting course, making him carry a 30-pound ammunition box, do overhead presses with it, do pushups and run up a hill, with shooting mixed in. Tiger struggled with slowing his heart rate down enough to hit the targets, but he attacked the course.</p>

  <p>“He went all out,” Marshall said. “He just f—ing went all out.”</p>

  <p>Marshall got his golf clubs at one point and asked Tiger to sign his TaylorMade bag. Tiger refused, sheepishly, saying he couldn’t sign a competing brand. So Marshall challenged him to a driving contest for the signature. Both Marshall and Brown confirmed what happened next: Tiger grinned and agreed. Some other guys gathered around a raised area overlooking the shooting range. Marshall went first and hit a solid drive, around 260 or 270 yards. Tiger looked at him and teed up a ball, gripping the TaylorMade driver.</p>

  <p>Then he got down on his knees.</p>

  <p>He swung the club like a baseball bat and crushed one out past Marshall’s drive. Tiger started laughing, and then all the SEALs started laughing, and eventually Marshall was laughing too.</p>

  <p>“Well, I can just shoot you now and you can die,” Marshall joked, “or you can run and die tired.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, Woods held a <a href="https://twitter.com/GWJuniorTour/status/723275985894957056">demo</a> for <a href="https://twitter.com/GWJuniorTour/status/723277404169461760">Golfweek Junior Tour</a> and is seen hitting golf balls publicly since <a href="https://twitter.com/TigerWoods/status/702492113188032512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">late February</a>.</p>
