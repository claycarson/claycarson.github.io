  <p>Also, dogs are faithful and they do not tell lies because they cannot talk.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I also said that I cared about dogs because they were faithful and honest, and some dogs were cleverer and more interesting than some people. Steve, for example, who comes to the school on Thursdays, needs help to eat his food and could not even fetch a stick. Siobhan asked me not to say this to Steve’s mother.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I sometimes think of my mind as a machine, but not always as a bread-slicing machine. It makes it easier to explain to other people what is going on inside it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But I don’t take any notice because I don’t listen to what other people say and only sticks and stones can break my bones and I have my Swiss Army knife if they hit me and if I kill them it will be self-defense and I won’t go to prison.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Intuition can sometimes get things wrong. And intuition is what people use in life to make decisions. But logic can help you work out the right answer.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But sometimes we get sad about things and we don’t like to tell other people that we are sad about them. We like to keep it a secret. Or sometimes we are sad but we don’t really know we are sad.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Except I can’t remember anything before I was about 4 because I wasn’t looking at things in the right way before then, so they didn’t get recorded properly.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>No more things should be presumed to exist than are absolutely necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But feelings are just having a picture on the screen in your head of what is going to happen tomorrow or next year, or what might have happened instead of what did happen, and if it is a happy picture they smile and if it is a sad picture they cry.</p>
