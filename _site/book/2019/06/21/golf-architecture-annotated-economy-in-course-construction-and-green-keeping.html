  		<h2 id="chapter-i">Chapter I</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The chief object of every golf architect or green - keeper worth his salt is to imitate the beauties of nature so closely as to make his work indistinguishable from nature itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most golfers have an entirely erroneous view of the real object of hazards. The majority of them simply look upon hazards as a means of punishing a bad shot, when their real object is to make the game interesting.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="chapter-iii">Chapter III</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ideal hole is surely one that affords the greatest pleasure to the greatest number, gives the fullest advantage for accurate play, stimulates players to improve their game, and never becomes monotonous.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why should not even an open champion occasionally have a shot that the long handicap man is frequently compelled to play?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In an ideal long hole, there should not only be a big advantage from successfully negotiating a long carry for the tee shot, but the longer the drive, the greater the advantage should be. A shorter driver should also, by extreme accuracy, be able to gain an advantage over a long hitting but less accurate opponent.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>An ideal hole should provide an infinite variety of shots according to the varying positions of the tee, the situation of the flag, the direction and strength of the wind, etc. It should also at times give full advantage for the voluntary pull or slice, one of the most finished shots in golf, and one that few champions are able to carry out with any great degree of accuracy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="chapter-iv">Chapter IV</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Comparing the small amount of land utilised for golf with the large amount devoted to agriculture, we get infinitely more value out of the former than the latter. We all eat too much. During the Great War the majority were all the fitter for being rationed and getting a smaller amount of food, but none of us get enough fresh air, pleasurable excitement, and exercise.</p>
