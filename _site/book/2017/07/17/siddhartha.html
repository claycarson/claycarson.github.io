  		<h2 id="first-part">First Part</h2>
<h3 id="with-the-samanas">With the Samanas</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>A goal stood before Siddhartha, a single goal: to become empty, empty of thirst, empty of wishing, empty of dreams, empty of joy and sorrow. Dead to himself, not to be a self anymore, to find tranquility with an emptied heard, to be open to miracles in unselfish thoughts, that was his goal.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And Siddhartha said quietly, as if he was talking to himself: “What is meditation? What is leaving one’s body? What is fasting? What is holding one’s breath? It is fleeing from the self, it is a short escape of the agony of being a self, it is a short numbing of the senses against the pain and the pointlessness of life.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="second-part">Second Part</h2>
<h3 id="kamala">Kamala</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>What might you be able to do?” “I can think. I can wait. I can fast.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="with-the-childlike-people">With the Childlike People</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>When, for example, Siddhartha hadn’t learned to fast, he would have to accept any kind of service before this day is up, whether it may be with you or wherever, because hunger would force him to do so. But like this, Siddhartha can wait calmly, he knows no impatience, he knows no emergency, for a long time he can allow hunger to besiege him and can laugh about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Writing is good, thinking is better. Being smart is good, being patient is better.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But he has that mysterious quality of those people to whom success comes all by itself, whether this may be a good star of his birth, magic, or something he has learned among Samanas. He always seems to be merely playing without business-affairs, they never fully become a part of him, they never rule over him, he is never afraid of failure, he is never upset by a loss.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most people, Kamala, are like a falling leaf, which is blown and is turning around through the air, and wavers, and tumbles to the ground. But others, a few, are like stars, they go on a fixed course, no wind reaches them, in themselves they have their law and their course.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="by-the-river">By the River</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Then, out of remote areas of his soul, out of past times of his now weary life, a sound stirred up. It was a word, a syllable, which he, without thinking, with a slurred voice, spoke to himself, the old word which is the beginning and the end of all prayers of the Brahmans, the holy “Om”, which roughly means “that what is perfect” or “the completion”. And in the moment when the sound of “Om” touched Siddhartha’s ear, his dormant spirit suddenly woke up and realized the foolishness of his actions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wondrous indeed was my life, so he thought, wondrous detours it has taken. As I boy, I had only to do with gods and offerings. As a youth, I had only to do with asceticism, with thinking and meditation, was searching for Brahman, worshipped the eternal in the Atman. But as a young man, I followed the penitents, lived in the forest, suffered of heat and frost, learned to hunger, taught my body to become dead. Wonderfully, soon afterwards, insight came towards me in the form of the great Buddha’s teachings, I felt the knowledge of the oneness of the world circling in me like my own blood. But I also had to leave Buddha and the great knowledge. I went and learned the art of love with Kamala, learned trading with Kamaswami, piled up money, wasted money, learned to love my stomach, learned to please my senses. I had to spend many years losing my spirit, to unlearn thinking again, to forget the oneness. Isn’t it just as if I had turned slowly and on a long detour from a man into a child, from a thinker into a childlike person? And yet, this path has been very good; and yet, the bird in my chest has not died. But what a path has this been! I had to pass through so much stupidity, through so much vices, through so many errors, through so much disgust and disappointments and woe, just to become a child again and to be able to start over. But it was right so, my heart says “Yes” to it, my eyes smile to it. I’ve had to experience despair, I’ve had to sink down to the most foolish one of all thoughts, to the thought of suicide, in order to be able to experience divine grace, to hear Om again, to be able to sleep properly and awake properly again. I had to become a fool, to find Atman in me again. I had to sin, to be able to live again. Where else might my path lead me to? It is foolish, this path, it moves in loops, perhaps it is going around in a circle. Let it go as it likes, I want to take it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It is good,” he thought, “to get a taste of everything for oneself, which one needs to know. That lust for the world and riches do not belong to the good things, I have already learned as a child. I have known it for a long time, but I have experienced only now. And now I know it, don’t just know it in my memory, but in my eyes, in my heart, in my stomach. Good for me, to know this!”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-ferryman">The Ferryman</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>A quiet heart, with a waiting, opened soul, without passion, without a wish, without judgement, without an opinion.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Yes, Siddhartha,” he spoke. “It is this what you mean, isn’t it: that the river is everywhere at once, at the source and at the mouth, at the waterfall, at the ferry, at the rapids, in the sea, in the mountains, everywhere at once, and that there is only the present time for it, not the shadow of the past, not the shadow of the future?” “This it is,” said Siddhartha. “And when I had learned it, I looked at my life, and it was also a river, and the boy Siddhartha was only separated from the man Siddhartha and from the old man Siddhartha by a shadow, not by something real. Also, Siddhartha’s previous births were no past, and his death and his return to Brahma was no future. Nothing was, nothing will be; everything is, everything has existence and is present.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-son">The Son</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Through all this, the son let him commit his foolish acts, let him court for his affection, let him humiliate himself every day by giving in to his moods.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="govinda">Govinda</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Wisdom which a wise man tries to pass on to someone always sounds like foolishness.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The opposite of every truth is just as true! That’s like this: any truth can only be expressed and put into words when it is one-sided. Everything is one-sided which can be thought with thoughts and said with words, it’s all one-sided, all just one half, all lacks completeness, roundness, oneness.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is not possible for any person to see how far another one has already progressed on his path.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I see whatever exists as good, death is to me like life, sin like holiness, wisdom like foolishness, everything has to be as it is, everything only requires my consent, only my willingness, my loving agreement, to be good for me, to do nothing but work for my benefit, to be unable to ever harm me.</p>
</blockquote>
