  		<h2 id="part-one">PART ONE</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Every warrior virtue proceeds from this—courage, selflessness, love of and loyalty to one’s comrades, patience, self-command, the will to endure adversity.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In victory, do not brag; in defeat, do not weep.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ancients resisted innovation in warfare because they feared it would rob the struggle of honor. King Agis was shown a new catapult, which could shoot a killing dart 200 yards. When he saw this, he wept. “Alas,” he said. “Valor is no more.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was a footrace in Sparta each year among the boys. They ran ten miles, barefoot, carrying a mouthful of water. The boys were not allowed to swallow any of the water but had to spit it all out at the end of the race.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="part-three">PART THREE</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Let us conduct ourselves so that all men wish to be our friends and all fear to be our enemies.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fix your mind upon its object. Hold to this, unswerving, Disowning fear and hope, Advance only upon this goal.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In their book King, Warrior, Magician, Lover, authors Robert Moore and Douglas Gillette tell us that the human individual matures from archetype to archetype. A boy, for instance, evolves sequentially through the youth, the wanderer, the lover, the warrior, through husband and father to teacher, king, sage and mystic.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alexander’s party was trying to get through the busy street, but the yogis had their spot and they wouldn’t move. One of Alexander’s zealous young lieutenants took it upon himself to chase the holy men out of the king’s path. When one of the wise men resisted, the officer started verbally abusing him. Just then, Alexander came up. The lieutenant pointed to Alexander and said to the yogi, “This man has conquered the world! What have you accomplished?” The yogi looked up calmly and replied, “I have conquered the need to conquer the world.” At this, Alexander laughed with approval. He admired the naked wise men. “Could I be any man in the world other than myself,” he said, “I would be this man here.”</p>
