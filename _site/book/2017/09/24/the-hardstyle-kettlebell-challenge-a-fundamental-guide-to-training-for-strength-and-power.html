<blockquote>
  <p>Instead it is the ability to hold together “in one piece”, as I say in one of my three key principles of training: The body is one piece. There are three kinds of strength training: putting weights overhead, picking them up off the ground, and/ or carrying them for time or distance. All training is complementary.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anaconda strength is the body squeezing and the inner tube of the body pushing back to keep integrity.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Armor building is the development of callouses or body armor to withstand the contact and collisions with other people and the environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="why-the-hkc">Why the HKC?</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>I have spent my life trying to understand weightlifting. It seems to me that there are three important keys: Fundamental Human Movements Reps and Sets Load I also think this is the correct order to approach weightlifting. First, we need to establish the correct postures and patterns, then work around a reasonable number of movements in a training session.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here are the basics of proper training: Training sessions need to be repeatable. Training sessions should put you on the path of progress towards your goals. Training sessions should focus on quality. What is the key to quality? I have a simple answer for most people: control your repetitions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, memorize this: Hinge (swings, jumps): deep hip movement, minimal knee movement. Squats: deep hip movement, deep knee movement.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Next, try this little drill. Stand arms-length away from a door knob. Grab the door knob with both hands and get your chest up. Up? Imagine being on a California beach when a swimsuit model walks by. When I have an athlete do this, he will immediately puff up his chest, which tightens the lower back and locks the whole upper body. The lats naturally spread a bit and the shoulders come back a little, too. Doorknob squat with partner Now, lower yourself down.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The full list, if you’re are interested, is here:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Constant assessment.</li>
    <li>Constant upgrading.</li>
    <li>Ignore perfect.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This isn’t Moral Theology—there are no “good” or “bad” exercises or training systems. Everything works! Achieving a goal versus success. After the peak is the cliff. Self-discipline is a finite resource. Fundamentals trump everything else. Take a moment to appreciate those who went before you.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="programming-the-hkc">Programming the HKC</h2>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Push</li>
    <li>Pull</li>
    <li>Hinge</li>
    <li>Squat</li>
    <li>Loaded Carries</li>
    <li>Everything Else</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, some programming “rules” are emerging: Do all of the fundamental human movements. Push, pull and squat rep numbers must have the same totals. Use the hinge and loaded carry families to improve athletic qualities and work capacity. Include enough of “everything else” to keep the client functioning and safe.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="general-principles-for-the-rest-of-us-lessons-from-elite-athletics">General Principles for the “Rest of Us” Lessons from Elite Athletics</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Train appropriately for goal(s). Train little and often over the long haul. The longer it takes to get in shape, the longer the shape will remain. Warm-ups and cool-downs really do play important roles. Train for volume before intensity.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will do the fundamental human movements with appropriate reps, sets and load and strive for mastery of movement.</p>
