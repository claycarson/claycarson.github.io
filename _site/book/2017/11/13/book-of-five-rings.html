  		<blockquote>
  <p>The principle of strategy is having one thing, to know ten thousand things.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It will seem difficult at first, but everything is difficult at first.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You should not have a favorite weapon. To become over-familiar with one weapon is as much a fault as not knowing it sufficiently well. You should not copy others, but use weapons which you can handle properly. It is bad for commanders and troopers to have likes and dislikes. These are things you must learn thoroughly.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do not think dishonestly. The Way is in training. Become acquainted with every art. Know the Ways of all professions. Distinguish between gain and loss in worldly matters. Develop intuitive judgement and understanding for everything. Perceive those things which cannot be seen. Pay attention even to trifles. Do nothing which is of no use.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In strategy your spiritual bearing must not be any different from normal. Both in fighting and in everyday life you should be determined though calm. Meet the situation without tenseness yet not recklessly, your spirit settled yet unbiased. Even when your spirit is calm do not let your body relax, and when your body is relaxed do not let your spirit slacken. Do not let your spirit be influenced by your body, or your body be influenced by your spirit. Be neither insufficiently spirited nor over spirited. An elevated spirit is weak and a low spirit is weak. Do not let the enemy see your spirit.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you cannot be deceived by men you will have realized the wisdom of strategy.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In strategy it is important to see distant things as if they were close and to take a distanced view of close things.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You must make the best of the situation, see through the enemy’s spirit so that you grasp his strategy and defeat him. It is impossible to write about this in detail.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You once make an attack and fail, there is little chance of success if you use the same approach again. If you attempt a technique which you have previously tried unsuccessfully and fail yet again, then you must change your attacking method.</p>
