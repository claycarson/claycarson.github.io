<h3 id="15-maximus">15. Maximus</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sense he gave of <em>staying</em> on the path rather than being <em>kept</em> on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="16-my-adopted-father">16. My Adopted Father</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Compassion. Unwavering adherence to decisions, once he’d reached them. Indifference to superficial honors. Hard work. Persistence.</p>

  <p>Listening to anyone who could contribute to the public good.</p>

  <p>His dogged determination to treat people as they deserved.</p>

  <p>A sense of when to push and when to back off.</p>

  <p>Putting a stop to the pursuit of boys.</p>

  <p>His altruism. Not expecting his friends to keep him entertained at dinner or to travel with him (unless they wanted to). And anyone who had to stay behind to take care of something always found him the same when he returned.</p>

  <p>His searching questions at meetings. A kind of single-mindedness, almost, never content with first impressions, or breaking off the discussion prematurely.</p>

  <p>His constancy to friends-never getting fed up with them, or playing favorites.</p>

  <p>Self-reliance, always. And cheerfulness.</p>

  <p>And his advance planning (well in advance) and his discreet attention to even minor things.</p>

  <p>His restrictions on acclamations-and all attempts to flatter him.</p>

  <p>His constant devotion to the empire’s needs. His stewardship the treasury. His willingness to take responsibility-and blame-for both.</p>

  <p>His attitude to the gods: no superstitiousness. And his attitude to men: no demagoguery, no currying favor, no pandering. Alway gained from doing it. Always sober, always steady, and never vulgar or prey to fads.</p>

  <p>The way he handled the material comforts that fortune had supplied him in such abundance-without arrogance and without apology. If there were there, he took advantage of them. If not, he didn’t miss them.</p>

  <p>No one ever called him glib, or shameless, or pedantic. They saw him for what he was: a man tested by life, accomplished, unswayed by flattery, qualified to govern both himself and them.</p>

  <p>His respect for people who practiced philosophy-at least, those who were sincere about it. But without denigrating the others-or listening to them.</p>

  <p>His ability to feel at ease with people-and put them at <em>there</em> ease, without being pushy.</p>

  <p>His willingness to take adequate care of himself. Not a hypochondriac or obsessed with his appearance, but not ignoring things either. With the result that he hardly ever needed medical attention, or drugs or any sort of salve or ointment.</p>

  <p>This, in particular: his willingness to yield the floor to experts–in oratory, law, psychology, whatever–and to support them energetically, so that each of them could fulfill his potential.</p>

  <p>That he respected tradition without needing to constantly congratulate himself for Safeguarding Our Traditional Values.</p>

  <p>Not prone to go off on tangents, or pulled in all directions, but sticking with the same old places and the same old things.</p>

  <p>The way he could have one of his migraines and then go right back to what he was doing-fresh and at the top of his game.</p>

  <p>That he had so few secrets-only state secrets, in fact, and not all that many of those.</p>

  <p>The way he kept public actions within reasonable bounds-games, building projects, distributions of money and so on–because he looked to what needed doing and not the credit to be gained from doing both.</p>

  <p>No bathing at strange hours, no self-indulgent building projects no concern for food, or the cut and color of his clothes, or haying attractive slaves. (The robe from his farm at Lorium, most of the things at Lanuvium, the way he accepted the customs agent’s way apology at Tusculum, etc.)</p>

  <p>He never exhibited rudeness, lost control of himself, or turned violent. No one ever saw him sweat. Everything was to be approached logically and with due consideration, in a calm and orderly fashion but decisively, and with no loose ends.</p>

  <p>You could have said of him (as they say of Socrates) that he knew how to enjoy and abstain from things that most people find it hard to abstain from and all too easy to enjoy. Strength, perseverance, self-control in both areas: the mark of a soul in readiness–indomitable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That I wasn’t more talented in rhetoric or poetry, or other areas. If I’d felt that I was making better progress I might never have given them up.</p>

  <p>[…]</p>

  <p>That when I became interested in philosophy I didn’t fall into the hands of charlatans, and didn’t get bogged down in writing treatises, or become absorbed by logic-chopping, or preoccupied with physics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The world is maintained by change–in the elements and in the things they compose. That should be enough for you; treat it as an axiom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>4.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a limit to the time assigned you, and if you don’t use it to free yourself it will be gone and will never return.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>5.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Concentrate every minute like a Roman-like a man–on doing what’s in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing yourself from all other distractions. Yes, you can-if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable. You see how few things you have to do to live a satisfying and reverent life? If you can manage this, that’s all even the gods can ask of you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>6.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone gets one life. Yours is almost used up, and instead of treating yourself with respect, you have entrusted your own happiness to the souls of others.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Page 20 -->
<p>11.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think. If the gods exist, then to abandon human beings is not frightening; the gods would never subject you to harm. And they don’t exist, or don’t care what happens to us, what would he the point of living in a world without gods or Providence? But they do exist, they do care what happens to us, and everything a person needs to avoid real harm they have placed within him. If there were anything harmful on the other side of death, they would have made sure that the ability to avoid it was within you. If it doesn’t harm your character, how can it harm your life? Nature would not have overlooked such dangers through failing to recognize them, or because it saw them but was powerless to prevent or correct them. Nor would it ever, through inability or incompetence, make such a mistake as to let good and bad things happen indiscriminately to good and bad alike. <strong>But death and life, success and failure, pain and pleasure, wealth and poverty, all these happen to good and bad alike, and they are neither noble nor shameful-and hence neither good nor bad.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="book-3">Book 3</h2>

<!-- Page 31 -->
<p>6.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would be wrong for anything to stand between you and attaining goodness– as a rational being and a citizen. Anything at all: the applause of the crowd, high office, wealth, or self-indulgence. All of them might seem to be compatible with it– for a while. But suddenly they control us and sweep us away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>7.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Never regard something as doing you good if it makes you betray a trust, or lose your sense of shame, or makes you show hatred, suspicion, ill will, or hypocrisy, or a desire for things best done behind closed doors. If you can privilege your own mind, guiding spirit and your reverence for its powers, that should clear of dramatics, of wailing and gnashing of teeth. You won’t need solitude-or a cast of thousands, either. Above all, you’ll be free of fear and desire. And how long your body will contain the soul that inhabits it will cause you not a moment’s worry. If it’s time for you to go, leave willingly-as you would to accomplish anything that can be done with grace and honor. And concentrate on this, your whole life long: for your mind to be in the right state-the state a rational, civic mind should be in.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Page 32 -->
<p>10.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Forget everything else. Keep hold of this alone and remember it: Each of us lives only now, this brief instant. The rest has bee lived already; or is impossible to see. Thes pan we live is small–small as the corner of the earch in which we live it. Small as even the greatest renown, passed from outh to mouth by short-lived stick figures, ignorant alike of themselves and those long dead.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Page 33 -->
<p>12.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you do the job in a principled way, with diligence, energy and pations, if you keep yourself free of distractions, and keep the spirit inside you undamaged, as if you might have to give it back at any moment–</p>

  <p>If you can embrace this without fear or expectation–can find fulfillment in what you’re doing now, as Nature intended, and in superhuman truthfulness (every wod, every utterance)– then your life with be happy.</p>

  <p>No one can prevent that.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="book-4">Book 4</h2>

<!-- Page 37 -->
<p>3.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People try to get away from it all-to the country, to the beach, to the mountains. You always wish that you could too. Which is idiotic: you can get away from it anytime you like.</p>

  <p>By going within.</p>

  <p>Nowhere you can go is more peaceful-more free of interruptions-than your own soul. Especially if you have other things to rely on. An instant’s recollection and there it is: complete tranquillity. And by tranquillity I mean a kind of harmony.</p>

  <p>So keep getting away from it all-like that. Renew yourself. But keep it brief and basic. A quick visit should be enough to ward off all&lt;…&gt; and send you back ready to face what awaits you.</p>

  <p>What’s there to complain about? People’s misbehavior? But take into consideration:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>that rational beings exist for one another;</li>
    <li>that doing what’s right sometimes requires patience;</li>
    <li>that no one does the wrong thing deliberately;</li>
    <li>and the number of people who have feuded and envied and hated and fought and died and been buried.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>… and keep your mouth shut.</p>

  <p>Or are you complaining about the things the world assigns you? But consider the two options: Providence or atoms. And all the arguments for seeing the world as a city.</p>

  <p>Or is it your body? Keep in mind that when the mind detaches itself and realizes its own nature, it no longer has anything to do with ordinary life-the rough and the smooth, either one. And remember all you’ve been taught-and accepted-about pain and pleasure.</p>

  <p>Or is it your reputation that’s bothering you? But look at how soon we’re all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. The emptiness of all those applauding hands. The people who praise us-how capricious they are, how arbitrary. And the tiny region in which it all takes place. The whole earth a point in space and most of it uninhabited. How many people there will be to admire you, and who they are.</p>

  <p>So keep this refuge in mind: the back roads of your self. Above all, no strain and no stress. Be straightforward. Look at things like a man, like a human being, like a citizen, like a mortal. And among the things you turn to, these two:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>That things have no hold on the soul. They stand there unmoving, outside it. Disturbance comes only from within–from our own perceptions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>That everything you see will soon alter and cease to exist. Think of how many changes you’ve already seen.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>“The world is nothing but change. Our life is only perception.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Choose not to be harmed–and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed–and you haven’t been</p>
</blockquote>

<p>8.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It can ruin your life only if it ruins your character. Otherwise it cannot harm you–inside or out.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Page 41 -->
<p>19.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People who are excited by posthumous fame forget that the people who remember them will soon die too. And those after them in turn. Until their memory, passed from one to another like a candle flame, gutters and goes out</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Page 42 -->
<p>24.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If you seek tranquillity, do less.” Or (more accurately) do what’s essential–what the logos of a social being requires, and in the requisite way. Which brings a double satisfaction: to do less, better.</p>

  <p>Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you’ll have more time, and more tranquillity. As yourself at every moment, “Is this necessary?”</p>

  <p>But we need to eliminate unnecessary assumptions as well. To eliminate the unnecessary actions that follow.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Page 43 -->

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t be disturbed. Uncomplicate yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Page 44 -->
<p>31.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Love the discipline you know, and let it support you. Entrust everything willingly to the gods, and then make your way through life–<strong>No one’s master and no one’s slave.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Page 45 -->
<p>32.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’re better off not giving small things more time than they deserve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>33.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then what should we work for?</p>

  <p>Only this: proper understanding; unselfish action; truthful speech. A resolve to accept whatever happens as necessary and familiar, flowing like water from the same source and spring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>36.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Constant awareness that everything is born from change. The knowledge that there is nothing nature loves more than to alter what exists and make  new things like it. All that exists is the seed of what will emerge from it.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Page 46 -->
<p>39.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nothing that goes on in anyone else’s mind can harm you. Nor can the shifts and changes in the world around you.</p>

  <p>-Then where is harm to be found?</p>

  <p>In your capacity to see it. Stop doing that and everything will be fine. Let the part of you that makes that judgment keep quiet even if the body it’s attached to is stabbed or burnt, or stinking with pus, or consumed by cancer. Or to put it another way: It needs to realize that what happens to everyone-bad and good alike-is neither good nor bad. That what happens in every life-lived naturally or not-is neither natural nor unnatural.</p>

  <p>“A little wisp of soul carrying a corpse. – Epictetus”</p>

<p>43.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Time is a river, a violent current of events, glimpsed once and already carried past us, and another follows and is gone.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Page 47 -->

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose that a god announced that you were going to die tomorrow “or the day after”. Unless you were a complete coward you wouldn’t kick up a fuss about which day it was–what difference could it make? <strong>Now recognize that the difference between years from now and tomorrow is just as small.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Page 48 -->
<p>48.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In short, know this: Human lives are brief and trivial. Yesterday a blob of semen; tomorrow embalming fluid, ash.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>49a.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s unfortunate that this has happened.</p>

  <p>No. It’s fortunate that this has happened and I’ve remained unharmed by it-not shattered by the present or frightened of the future. It could have happened to anyone. But not everyone could have remained unharmed by it. Why treat the one as a misfortune rather than the other as fortunate? Can you really call something a misfortune that doesn’t violate human nature? Or do you think something that’s not against nature’s will can violate it? But you know what its will is. Does what’s happened keep you from acting with justice, generosity, self-control, sanity, prudence, honesty, humility, straightforwardness, and all the other qualities that allow a person’s nature to fulfill itself?</p>

  <p>So remember this principle when something threatens to cause you pain: the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is great good fortune.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="book-5">Book 5</h2>

<!-- Page 53 -->
<p>1.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself “I have to go to work-as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for-the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?”</p>

  <p>-But it’s nicer here….</p>

  <p>So you were born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you’re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?</p>

  <p>-But we have to sleep sometime….</p>

  <p>Agreed. But nature set a limit on that-as it did on eating and drinking. And you’re over the limit. You’ve had more than enough of that. But not of working. There you’re still below your quota.</p>

  <p>You don’t love yourself enough. Or you’d love your nature too, and what it demands of you. People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to wash or eat. Do you have less respect for your own nature than the engraver does for engraving, the dancer for the dance, the miser for money or the social climber for status? When they’re really possessed by what they do, they’d rather stop eating and sleeping than give up practicing their arts.</p>

  <p>Is helping others less valuable to you? Not worth your effort?</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Page 56 -->
<p>3.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If action or utterance is appropriate, then it’s appropriate for you. Don’t be put off by other people’s comments and criticism. If it’s right to say or do, then it’s the right thing for you to do or say.</p>

  <p>The others obey their own lead, follow their own impulses. Don’t be distracted. Keep walking. Follow your own nature, and follow Nature–along the road they share.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>8.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So there are two reasons to embrace what happens. One is that it’s happening to <em>you</em>. It was prescribed for you, and it pertains to you. The thread was spun long ago, by the oldest cause of all.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Page 57 -->
<p>9.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not to feel exasperated, or defeated, or despondent because your days aren’t packed with wise and moral actions. But to get back up when you fail, to celebrate behaving like a human–however imperfectly–and fully embrace the pursuit that you’ve embarked on.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Page 58 -->
<p>13.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am made up of substance and what animates it, and neither one can ever stop existing, any more than it began to. Every portion of me will be reassigned as another portion of the world, and that in turn transformed into another. Ad infinitum.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- Page 60 -->
<p>18.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nothing happens to anyone that he can’t endure. The same thing happens to other people, and they weather it unharmed–out of sheer obliviousness or because they want to display “character.” Is wisdom really so much weaker than ignorance and vanity?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you think you’ve been injured, apply this rule: If the community isn’t injured by it, neither am I. And if it is, anger is not the answer. Show the offender where he went wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So it would take an idiot to feel self-importance or distress. Or an indignation either. As if the things that irritate us lasted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>25.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So other people hurt me? That’s their problem. Their character and actions are not mine.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consider all that you’ve gone through, all that you’ve survived. And that the story of your life is done, your assignment complete. How many good things have you seen? How much pain and pleasure have you resisted? How many honors have you declined? How many unkind people have you been kind to?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>33.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wait for it patiently–annihilation or metamorphosis.</p>

  <p>–And until that time comes–what?</p>

  <p>Honor and revere the gods, treat human beings as they deserve, be tolerant with others and strict with yourself. Remember, nothing belongs to you but your flesh and blood–and nothing else under your control.</p>

  <p>If anyone can refute me–show me I’m making a mistake or looking at things from the wrong perspective–I’ll gladly change. It’s the truth I’m after, and the truth never harmed anyone. What harms us is to persist in self-deceit and ignorance.</p>

  <p>To escape imperialization-that indelible stain. It happens. Make sure you remain straightforward, upright, reverent, serious, unadorned, an ally of justice, pious, kind, affectionate, and doing your duty with a will. Fight to be the person philosophy tried to make you.</p>

  <p>Revere the gods; watch over human beings. Our lives are short.</p>

  <p><strong>The only rewards of our existence here are an unstained character and unselfish acts.</strong></p>

  <p>Take Antoninus as your model, always. His energy in doing what was rational…his steadiness in any situation…his sense of reverence … his calm expression…his gentleness…his modesty..his eagerness to grasp things. And how he never let things go before he was sure he had examined them thoroughly, understood them perfectly…the way he put up with unfair criticism, without returning it…how he couldn’t be hurried… how he wouldn’t listen to informers… how reliable he was as a judge of character, and of way he actions… not prone to backbiting, or cowardice, or jealousy, or  empty rhetoric…content with the basics-in living quarters, bedding clothes, food, servants… how hard he worked, how much he put up with… his ability to work straight through till dusk-because of his simple diet (he didn’t even need to relieve himself, except at set times)…his constancy and reliability as a friend…his tolerance of people who openly questioned his views and his delight at seeing his ideas improved on…his piety-without a trace of superstition…</p>

  <p>So that when your time comes, your conscience will be as clear as his.</p>

  <p>All of us are working on the same project. Some consciously with understanding; some without knowing it.

And those who complain and try to obstruct and thwart things-they help as much as anyone. The world needs them as well.</p>

  <p>So make up your mind who you’ll choose to work with. The force that directs all things will make good use of you regardless–will put you on its payroll and set you to work. But make sure it’s not the job Chrysippus speaks of: the bad line in the play, put there for laughs.</p>

  <p>And if they haven’t made decisions about me as an individual, they certainly have about the general welfare. And anything that follows from that is something I have to welcome and embrace.</p>

  <p>And if they make no decisions, about anything-and it’s blasphemous even to think so (because if so, then let’s stop sacrificing, praying, swearing oaths, and doing all the other things we do, believing the whole time that the gods are right here with us)-if they decide nothing about our lives… well, I can still make decisions.

  <p><strong>So this is how a thoughtful person should await death: not with indifference, not with impatience, not with disdain, but simply viewing it as one of the things that happen to us.

  <p>Or perhaps you need some tidy aphorism to tuck away in the back of your mind. Well, consider two things that should reconcile you to death: the nature of the things you’ll leave behind you, and the kind of people you’ll no longer be mixed up with. There’s no need to feel resentment toward them-in fact, you should look out for their well-being, and be gentle with them-but keep in mind that <strong>everything you believe is meaningless to those you leave behind</strong>. Because that’s all that could restrain us (if anything could)-the only thing that could make us want to stay here: the chance to live with those who share our vision. But now?
