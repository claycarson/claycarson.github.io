<blockquote>
  <p>In todayâ€™s world of fear and unease and social distancing, itâ€™s hard to imagine sharing experiences like these ever again. I donâ€™t know when it will be safe to return to singing arm in arm at the top of our lungs, hearts racing, bodies moving, souls bursting with life. But I do know that we will do it again, because we have to. Itâ€™s not a choice. Weâ€™re human. We need moments that reassure us that we are not alone. That we are understood. That we are imperfect. And, most important, that we need each other. I have shared my music, my words, my life with the people who come to our shows. And they have shared their voices with me. Without that audienceâ€”that screaming, sweating audienceâ€”my songs would only be sound. But together, we are instruments in a sonic cathedral, one that we build together night after night. And one that we will surely build again.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28973557/the-last-dance-updates-untold-story-michael-jordan-chicago-bulls">â€The Last Danceâ€ - The 10 part documentary chronicles the untold story of Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bullsâ€™ dynasty.</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œLook, winning has a price,â€ says Jordan. â€œAnd leadership has a price. So I pulled people along when they didnâ€™t want to be pulled. I challenged people when they didnâ€™t want to be challenged. And I earned that right because my teammates who came after me didnâ€™t endure all the things that I endured. Once you joined the team, you lived at a certain standard that I played the game. And I wasnâ€™t going to take any less. Now if that means I had to go in there and get in your ass a little bit, then I did that. You ask all my teammates. The one thing about Michael Jordan was he never asked me to do something that he didnâ€™t fucking do. When people see this they are going say, â€˜Well he wasnâ€™t really a nice guy. He may have been a tyrant.â€™ Well, thatâ€™s you. Because you never won anything. I wanted to win, but I wanted them to win to be a part of that as well. Look, I donâ€™t have to do this. I am only doing it because it is who I am. Thatâ€™s how I played the game. That was my mentality. If you donâ€™t want to play that way, donâ€™t play that way. Break.â€</p>
