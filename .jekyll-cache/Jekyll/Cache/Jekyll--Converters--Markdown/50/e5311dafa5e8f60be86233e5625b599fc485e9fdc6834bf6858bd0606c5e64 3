<h2 id="the-way-the-world-ends-not-with-a-bang-but-a-paperclip">The Way The World Ends: Not With A Bang But A Paperclip</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-way-the-world-ends-not-with-a-bang-but-a-paperclip/" title="Wired">Wired</a> takes a look at <em><a href="http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html" title="Paperclips">Paperclips</a></em>, a clicker game from  <a href="http://gamecenter.nyu.edu/faculty/frank-lantz/" title="Frank Lantz">Frank Lantz</a> based on speculations in Nick Bostrom‚Äôs <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/1501227742" title="Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies">Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies</a></em>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/22/artificial-intelligence-oxford_n_5689858.html" title="Huffington Post interview">Huffington Post interview</a>, Bostrom makes his point much more succinctly, albeit less thorough, than a game or his book:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose we have an AI whose only goal is to make as many paper clips as possible. The AI will realize quickly that it would be much better if there were no humans because humans might decide to switch it off. Because if humans do so, there would be fewer paper clips. Also, human bodies contain a lot of atoms that could be made into paper clips. The future that the AI would be trying to gear towards would be one in which there were a lot of paper clips but no humans.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new prime number, also known as M77232917, is calculated by multiplying together 77,232,917 twos, and then subtracting one. <strong>It is nearly one million digits larger than the previous record prime number</strong>, in a special class of extremely rare prime numbers known as Mersenne primes. It is only the 50th known Mersenne prime ever discovered, each increasingly difficult to find. Mersenne primes were named for the French monk Marin Mersenne, who studied these numbers more than 350 years ago.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Waste and recycling work is the fifth most fatal job in America ‚Äî far more deadly than serving as a police officer or a firefighter. Loggers have the highest fatality rate, followed by fishing workers, aircraft pilots and roofers. From the collection out on garbage trucks, to the processing at transfer stations and recycling centers, to the dumping at landfills, the waste industry averages about one worker fatality a week. Nationally, in 2016, 82 percent of waste-worker deaths occurred in the private sector.</p>

  <p>The public is often accused of being disconnected from its military, but frankly, it‚Äôs disconnected from just about everything.

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/01/when-your-eyes-move-so-do-your-eardrums/551237/" title="When Your Eyes Move, So Do Your Eardrums">When Your Eyes Move, So Do Your Eardrums</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Without moving your head, look to your left. Now look to your right. Keep flicking your eyes back and forth, left and right.</p>

  <p>Even if you managed to keep the rest of your body completely still, your eyeballs were not the only parts of your head that just moved. Your ears did, too. Specifically, your eardrums‚Äîthe thin membranes inside each of your ears‚Äîwobbled. As your eyes flitted right, both eardrums bulged to the left, one inward and one outward. They then bounced back and forth a few times, before coming to a halt. When you looked left, they bulged to the right, and oscillated again.</p>

  <p>[‚Ä¶]</p>

  <p>They also found that the eardrums start to wobble about 10 milliseconds before the eyes. This suggests that the ears aren‚Äôt reacting to what‚Äôs happening in the eyes. Instead, Groh says, ‚Äúthe brain is saying: I am about to move the eyes; ears, get ready.‚Äù</p>

<p>And while we are on the subject of hearing, find out why <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wjzepx/sonic-tonic-stressweek2017" title="Sonic Tonic">nature sounds can help you sleep and relax</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As life evolved on Earth, living beings developed different sensory organs to guide them toward food, alert them to danger, and find their way around the world. Without these senses, we couldn‚Äôt have survived. But sometimes, these very senses can cause our minds to get over-stimulated. When there‚Äôs too much noise, for example, it can be really distressing, but we usually can‚Äôt just turn off our hearing.</p>

  <p>From an evolutionary standpoint, this is beneficial to us. If there‚Äôs some danger in our environment, we can act accordingly (or wake up, if we happen to be asleep). Sudden sounds jolt us into action, get our hearts pumping, and the adrenaline and cortisol soaring in our bodies so as to prepare us for fight or flight.</p>

  <p>But living in a stream of constant, jarring noises can be highly toxic. One of the biggest problems with urban soundscapes, according to Benfield, is that people think they‚Äôve adjusted to them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment.</p>

  <p>By the same token, every human being has the freedom to change at any instant. Therefore, we can predict his future only within the large framework of a statistical survey referring to a whole group; the individual personality, however, remains essentially unpredictable. The basis for any predictions would be represented by biological, psychological or sociological conditions. Yet one of the main features of human existence is the capacity to rise above such conditions, to grow beyond them. Man is capable of changing the world for the better if possible, and of changing himself for the better if necessary.

<blockquote>
  <p>A well-accepted theory of psychology, marketing, and other fields is that human language reflects personality, thinking style, social connections, and emotional states. The frequency with which we use certain categories of words can provide clues to these characteristics. Several researchers found that variations in word usage in writings such as blogs, essays, and tweets can predict aspects of personality.</p>

  <p>IBM conducted a set of studies to understand whether personality characteristics inferred from social media data can predict people‚Äôs behavior and preferences.</p>

  <p>It was 1977, and we were leaving a photography session on 23rd Street. Jacques Morali saw the big pink YMCA on 23rd and asked, ‚ÄúWhat is this YMCA, anyway? ‚ÄúAnd after laughing at his accent, we told him the Y was a place where you could go when you first came to New York when you didn‚Äôt have any money ‚Äî you can stay there for very little. And of course, someone joked, ‚ÄúYeah, but don‚Äôt bend over in the showers. ‚ÄúAnd Jacques, bless his heart, said, ‚ÄúI will write a song about this!‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Frito-Lay had a formidable research complex near Dallas, where nearly 500 chemists, psychologists and technicians conducted research that cost up to $30 million a year, and the science corps focused intense amounts of resources on questions of crunch, mouth feel and aroma for each of these items. Their tools included a $40,000 device that simulated a chewing mouth to test and perfect the chips, discovering things like the perfect break point: people like a chip that snaps with about four pounds of pressure per square inch.</p>

  <p>To get a better feel for their work, I called on Steven Witherly, a food scientist who wrote a fascinating guide for industry insiders titled, ‚ÄúWhy Humans Like Junk Food.‚Äù I brought him two shopping bags filled with a variety of chips to taste. He zeroed right in on the Cheetos. ‚ÄúThis,‚Äù Witherly said, ‚Äúis one of the most marvelously constructed foods on the planet, in terms of pure pleasure.‚Äù He ticked off a dozen attributes of the Cheetos that make the brain say more. But the one he focused on most was the puff‚Äôs uncanny ability to melt in the mouth. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called vanishing caloric density,‚Äù Witherly said. ‚ÄúIf something melts down quickly, your brain thinks that there‚Äôs no calories in it‚Ä¶ you can just keep eating it forever.‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We deify willpower and self-control, and mock its absence. People who achieve through remarkable willpower are ‚Äústrong‚Äù and ‚Äúheroic.‚Äù People who need help or structure are ‚Äúweak.‚Äù This is crazy‚Äîbecause few of us can accurately gauge or predict our willpower. We not only overestimate it, we chronically underestimate the power of triggers in our environment to lead us astray. Our environment is a magnificent willpower-reduction machine.</p>

<h2 id="zip-it">Zip It‚Ä¶</h2>

<p><a href="https://qz.com/email/quartz-obsession/1264216/" title="Zippers">Zip it real good</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don‚Äôt ever expect to see how zippers are made at YKK. Founded in 1934, Yoshida K≈çgy≈ç Kabushikigaisha is the world‚Äôs zipper kingpin, and it keeps its manufacturing secrets under lock and key. As John Balzar explains in the <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/05/news/mn-19744/3" title="LA Times">Los Angeles Times</a>, that‚Äôs partly because YKK makes everything‚Äîand we mean everything‚Äîon its own.</p>

  <p>‚ÄúYKK smelts its own brass, concocts its own polyester, spins and twists its own thread, weaves and color-dyes cloth for its zipper tapes, forges and molds its scooped zipper teeth, extrudes the monofilament for coil zippers, hammers and paints the sliders, clamps the stops, attaches the dangley pulls in a thousand varieties, and even fabricates the cardboard boxes in which zippers are packaged. Naturally, YKK makes the machines that make the components.‚Äù</p>

  <p>Since YKK controls all aspects of its business, it‚Äôs widely viewed by design companies as the most dependable and consistent zipper brand on the planet. (Case in point: At <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/branded/2012/04/ykk_zippers_why_so_many_designers_use_them_.html" title="Slate">Slate</a>, Seth Stevenson points out that ‚ÄúWhen the Japanese earthquake hit in 2011 many supply chains were shredded, but YKK kept rolling along.‚Äù) For that reason alone, YKK is a major player in the (very niche) high-end zipper market.</p>

  <p>In a <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0265407518761225" title="How many hours does it take to make a friend?">new report</a> published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, Associate Professor of Communication Studies Jeffrey Hall found that it takes roughly 50 hours of time together to move from mere acquaintance to casual friend, 90 hours to go from that stage to simple ‚Äúfriend‚Äù status and more than 200 hours before you can consider someone your close friend.</p>

  <p>This means time spent hanging out, joking around, playing video games and the like. Hours spent working together just don‚Äôt count as much, Hall‚Äôs study found.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Telstar 18, the design for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, is as close to a perfect sphere as you can get. It has subtle pimples and six thermally bonded panels designed to avoid knuckling, which is the characteristic bobbing and weaving movement when a ball is kicked without spin. All 32 teams have been able to play with it since November in preparation for the tournament, which runs from June 14 to July 15. But despite its similarities to the old ball, players have grumbled about the Telstar 18. Compared to the last few World Cup balls, the Telstar 18 is very similar to the ball used for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. It won‚Äôt fly quite as far down the pitch, and will wobble in the air a little differently, but aerodynamic testing suggests it will be more stable in the air overall.</p>

  <p>I knew I was speeding. So I pull over, and I roll the window down, and I‚Äôm reaching over into the glove compartment to get my papers ‚Ä¶.</p>

  <p>‚Ä¶ Then I hear this voice. Big, booming voice.</p>

  <p>‚ÄúWHERE YOU G‚ÄôWAN, BOY?‚Äù</p>

  <p>I‚Äôm like, Damn, they got the sergeant on me or something?</p>

  <p>I turn to look out the window, and I can‚Äôt even see this dude‚Äôs face he‚Äôs so big. All I see is his chest.</p>

  <p>‚ÄúI SAID WHERE YOU G‚ÄôWAN BOY?‚Äù</p>

  <p>Then he bends down and looks in the window.</p>

  <p>Big, dumbass grin on his face.</p>

  <p>It‚Äôs Shaq.</p>

  <p>I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúYo! I‚Äôm going to practice! You made me late!‚Äù</p>

  <p>He don‚Äôt miss a beat. He taps side of my truck, turns around and says, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it. I‚Äôll pay your fine. Just holler at me.‚Äù</p>

  <p>I‚Äôm looking in the rearview mirror, like, How the hell ‚Ä¶</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection" title="Mercator Projection - Wikipedia">Mercator projection</a> is a cylindrical map projection presented by the Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569. It became the standard map projection for nautical navigation because of its ability to represent lines of constant course, known as rhumb lines or loxodromes, as straight segments that conserve the angles with the meridians. Although the linear scale is equal in all directions around any point, thus preserving the angles and the shapes of small objects (making it a conformal map projection), the Mercator projection distorts the size of objects as the latitude increases from the Equator to the poles, where the scale becomes infinite. So, for example, landmasses such as Greenland and Antarctica appear much larger than they actually are, relative to landmasses near the equator such as Central Africa.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oddly enough, every measurement of mass made anywhere on Earth is tied back to this one cylindrical object. Known as ‚ÄúLe Grand K,‚Äù the cylinder, cast in 1879, is kept carefully sequestered in a secure, controlled environment outside Paris.</p>

  <p>[‚Ä¶]</p>

  <p>On May 20, 2019, Le Grand K will lose its special status, and the mass of a kilogram will be defined by a fundamental constant of nature known as the Planck constant. At the same time, other mainstays of the metric system will also be revamped: the ampere (the unit of electric current), the kelvin (the unit of temperature) and the mole (the unit for amount of substance).</p>

  <p>Reeking of authenticity, <em>Angels with Filthy Souls</em> is not just a uniquely persuasive parody.

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose we have an AI whose only goal is to make as many paper clips as possible. The AI will realize quickly that it would be much better if there were no humans because humans might decide to switch it off. Because if humans do so, there would be fewer paper clips. Also, human bodies contain a lot of atoms that could be made into paper clips. The future that the AI would be trying to gear towards would be one in which there were a lot of paper clips but no humans.</p>

  <p>When Charles Barkley‚Äôs mother, Charcey Glenn, passed away in June 2015, Barkley‚Äôs hometown of Leeds, Alabama, came to the funeral to pay respects. But there was also an unexpected guest.</p>

  <p>Barkley‚Äôs friends couldn‚Äôt quite place him. He wasn‚Äôt a basketball player, he wasn‚Äôt a sports figure, and he wasn‚Äôt from Barkley‚Äôs hometown.

  <p>Honnold is twice as sensation-seeking as the average person, and fully 20 percent higher than the average high sensation seeker. The most likely explanation for his flatline amygdala activation in the scanner, Joseph says, is that the tasks she set for him simply were not strong enough tea.</p>

  <p>Honnold also scores as exceedingly conscientious, associated with the ability to concentrate, remain focused on a task, and see things through. He also surveyed high in premeditation, his typical modus operandi, and very low in neuroticism, making him unlikely to ruminate over unlikely outcomes or risks that are impossible to manage. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt have any fear to begin with,‚Äù Honnold says, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a lot less to control.‚Äù</p>

<p>TLDR; You should leave the flagstick in.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>The flagstick slows the ball by a greater factor than it decreases the time the ball spends suspended over the hole.</li>
    <li>Unless you have exceptional distance control, effective capture speed can remain about the same.</li>
    <li>Hitting the ball more firmly allows for a larger margin of error. It also reduces the tendency of a slow-moving putt to ‚Äúwobble‚Äù or be moved off-line due to imperfections.</li>
    <li>Players, particularly poorer putters, leave a lot of putts from 6‚Äô to 15‚Äô short. This change would let them be more aggressive.</li>
    <li>The situations where the flagstick should be removed (it leans too much, it‚Äôs moving around a lot in the wind) almost never occur.</li>
    <li>The flagstick offers an aid - it gives the player yet another point or two at which to aim.</li>

However, street golf seems to overshadow his true passion‚Ä¶ photography. Barr‚Äôs archive consists of thousands of mind blowing film photographs of NYC from the 1990‚Äôs to 2000‚Äôs.

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple had developed the iPhone in secret over those two and a half years, and for many inside the company, the device had only been known by the codenames ‚ÄúM68‚Äù and ‚ÄúPurple 2.‚Äù Apple was focused on surprising everyone with the iPhone, and that meant that many of the engineers working on the original handset didn‚Äôt even know what it would eventually look like.</p>

  <p>To achieve that level of secrecy, Apple created special prototype development boards that contained nearly all of the iPhone‚Äôs parts, spread out across a large circuit board. The Verge has obtained exclusive access to the original iPhone M68 prototype board from 2006 / 2007, thanks to Red M Sixty, a source that asked to remain anonymous. It‚Äôs the first time this board has been pictured publicly, and it provides a rare historical look at an important part of computing history, showing how Apple developed the original iPhone.</p>

<p><a href="https://czep.net/weblog/52cards.html">52 Cards Shuffled</a></p>

<p>Summarized:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Set a timer to count down 52! seconds (that‚Äôs 8.0658x1067 seconds).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stand on the equator, and take a step forward every billion years.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you‚Äôve circled the earth once, take a drop of water from the Pacific Ocean, and repeat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Pacific Ocean is empty, lay a sheet of paper down, refill the ocean and carry on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When your stack of paper reaches the sun, take a look at the timer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The 3 left-most digits won‚Äôt have changed. 8.063x1067 seconds left to go.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Repeat the whole process 1000 times to get 1/3 of the way through that time.</li>
</ul>

<p>5.385x1067 seconds left to go. To kill that time you try something else.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Shuffle a deck of cards, deal yourself 5 card poker hand every billion years.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each time you get a royal flush, buy a lottery ticket.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each time that ticket wins the jackpot, throw a grain of sand in the grand canyon</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the grand canyon‚Äôs full, take 1oz of rock off Mount Everest. Empty the canyon and start over again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When Everest has been leveled, check the timer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There‚Äôs barely any change. 5.364x1067 seconds.</p>

<p><strong>The timer would run out sometime during your 255th time through the process.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then the investigators had the program examine the likes of other Facebook users. If the software had as few as 10 [likes] for analysis, it was able to evaluate that person about as well as a co-worker did. Given 70 likes, the algorithm was about as accurate as a friend. With 300 [likes], it was more successful than the person‚Äôs spouse. Even more astonishing to the researchers, feeding likes into their program enabled them to predict whether someone suffered from depression or took drugs and even to infer what the individual studied in school.</p>

<p>From the unique perspective of Golden Bell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And the roars for him were unlike those even for Arnie and Jack. I think that‚Äôs because Tiger wasn‚Äôt adored like Arnie, and he wasn‚Äôt lionized like Jack. No there was something else about him, something more aspirational. I am not sure I can describe it ‚Äî I am no poet, I am the subject of poetry ‚Äî but as I understand it, Tiger offered to take the crowd to a place where golf had never gone. He was an astronaut. He hit shots no one had ever hit. He saw possibilities where others saw tree branches and double bogeys. He brought order to a disorderly game.</p>

  <p>Anyway, that‚Äôs how I have heard it described.</p>

  <p>Then, one day, something with Tiger Woods changed. One hears things, but I am not one to partake in rumors. But I could see that Tiger no longer commanded the game the way he had. The crowds still shouted for him, but their cheers were less confident and more nervous. He grew older. He seemed to have a different swing every time I saw him. And then, some years, he did not show up at all.</p>

  <p>This human element of the game adds color but it comes at a high cost: too many mistakes. In 2018, MLB umpires, made 34,294 incorrect ball and strike calls for an average of 14 per game or 1.6 per inning. Many umpires well exceeded this number. Some of these flubbed calls were game changing.</p>

  <p>On every swing a battle raged between his technical proficiency and mental fragility. He would stand over the ball, his mind jumbled with swing thoughts. His hands strangled the grip, his arms were knots of tension. The seconds would tick by, and he felt powerless to lift the club. Then the uncertainty would ebb just long enough to allow him to start his swing, and the resulting shot would be flawless.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prisoners take apart beard trimmers or CD players to get at the tiny motor, which they can adapt to make the tattoo needle go up and down quickly enough.</p>

  <p>The needle itself is often made from a metal guitar string split in two by holding it over an open flame until it snaps in half, creating a fine point. The springs inside gel pens can also flatten into needles.</p>

  <p>One former prisoner who now runs a tattoo shop said he used to make black ink by trapping soot in a milk carton placed over a burning pile of plastic razors or Bible pages. He would mix the leftover ash and soot with a bit of alcohol (for hygienic purposes).</p>

  <p>I used to DM during every BM. Then, one afternoon a few years ago, I slipped into a poop portal. Backpacking through remote wilderness in searing heat, I felt the telltale pang. Coffee, eggs, chorizo, and water were all rushing‚Äîscreamingly‚Äîto the exits. At the nearest rest stop, I dashed into a bathroom so single-mindedly I didn‚Äôt turn on the lights and collapsed onto the toilet. The immediate release, shrouded as it was in shadow, was cosmic, like waking up from a nightmare, realizing it‚Äôs Christmas, I‚Äôm 5 years old, and can fly. Though I haven‚Äôt yet been able to recreate every condition, to this day I try to dump in total darkness: no lights, no phone, the gulf between mind and body quaked shut.</p>

People often buy and use Ring doorbell cameras under the premise that they‚Äôre making their individual homes safer. But these people aren‚Äôt just making choices for themselves.

<blockquote>
  <p>Further entrenching automobile supremacy are laws that require landowners who build housing and office space to build housing for cars as well. In large part because of parking quotas, parking lots now cover more than a third of the land area of some U.S. cities; Houston is estimated to have 30 parking spaces for every resident. As the UCLA urban-planning professor Donald Shoup has written, this mismatch flows from legal mandates rather than market demand. Every employee who brings a car to the office essentially doubles the amount of space he takes up at work, and in urban areas his employer may be required by law to build him a $50,000 garage parking space.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A good golf course is a great asset to the nation. Those who harangue against land being diverted from agriculture and used for golf have little sense of proportion. Comparing the small amount of land utilised for golf with the large amount devoted to agriculture, we get infinitely more value out of the former than the latter. We all eat too much. During the Great War the majority were all the fitter for being rationed and getting a smaller amount of food, but none of us get enough fresh air, pleasurable excitement, and exercise. Health and happiness are everything in this world.

  <p>And after a quarter-century of hard work, they have abundant evidence to prove it. Give people a sugar pill, they have shown, and those patients ‚Äî especially if they have one of the chronic, stress-related conditions that register the strongest placebo effects and if the treatment is delivered by someone in whom they have confidence ‚Äî will improve. Tell someone a normal milkshake is a diet beverage, and his gut will respond as if the drink were low fat. Take athletes to the top of the Alps, put them on exercise machines and hook them to an oxygen tank, and they will perform better than when they are breathing room air ‚Äî even if room air is all that‚Äôs in the tank. Wake a patient from surgery and tell him you‚Äôve done an arthroscopic repair, and his knee gets better even if all you did was knock him out and put a couple of incisions in his skin. Give a drug a fancy name, and it works better than if you don‚Äôt.</p>

  <p>You don‚Äôt even have to deceive the patients. You can hand a patient with irritable bowel syndrome a sugar pill, identify it as such and tell her that sugar pills are known to be effective when used as placebos, and she will get better, especially if you take the time to deliver that message with warmth and close attention. Depression, back pain, chemotherapy-related malaise, migraine, post-traumatic stress disorder: The list of conditions that respond to placebos ‚Äî as well as they do to drugs, with some patients ‚Äî is long and growing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It‚Äôs not difficult to piece it together: With a video camera rolling, Richard would launch the balloon and freak out. He‚Äôd call the FAA and get the balloon tracked. There‚Äôd be a tearful reunion when Falcon emerged from the basement, where he‚Äôd been told to hide. Richard would call back and say his son wasn‚Äôt in the basket. They‚Äôd make sure the Fort Collins newspaper knew about the stray saucer and the drama behind it. The story might go nationwide. With publicity in full force and a recording of every moment, networks would fight over the Heenes‚Äô story.</p>

  <p>Except Falcon didn‚Äôt hide where he was told to. He hid in the garage attic, not in the basement. He played with his cars and he fell asleep. The FAA said Richard needed to call 911. Deputies showed up. Neighbors began searching for Falcon. And then that silvery balloon was careening across our television screens. That‚Äôs why Mayumi‚Äôs reunion with Falcon was so believable: For a few hours, she and Richard honestly worried their son had been swept away.</p>

  <p>In 2004, winner Rustam Kasimdzhanov walked away from the six-game world championship having lost 17 pounds. In October 2018, Polar, a U.S.-based company that tracks heart rates, monitored chess players during a tournament and found that 21-year-old Russian grandmaster Mikhail Antipov had burned 560 calories in two hours of sitting and playing chess ‚Äì or roughly what Roger Federer would burn in an hour of singles tennis.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To shed light on the software that has tilted the world on its axis, the editors polled computer scientists, software developers, historians, policymakers, and journalists. They were asked to pick: Which pieces of code had a huge influence? Which ones warped our lives? About 75 responded with all sorts of ideas, and Slate has selected 36. It‚Äôs not a comprehensive list‚Äîit couldn‚Äôt be, given the massive welter of influential code that‚Äôs been written. (One fave of mine that didn‚Äôt make the cut: ‚ÄúQuicksort‚Äù! Or maybe Ada Lovelace‚Äôs Bernoulli algorithm.) Like all lists, it‚Äôs meant to provoke thought‚Äîto help us ponder anew how code undergirds our lives and how decisions made by programmers ripple into the future.</p>

  <p>To understand how GPT-2 writes, imagine that you‚Äôve never learned any spelling or grammar rules, and that no one taught you what words mean. All you know is what you‚Äôve read in eight million articles that you discovered via Reddit, on an almost infinite variety of topics (although subjects such as Miley Cyrus and the Mueller report are more familiar to you than, say, the Treaty of Versailles). You have Rain Man-like skills for remembering each and every combination of words you‚Äôve read. Because of your predictive-text neural net, if you are given a sentence and asked to write another like it, you can do the task flawlessly without understanding anything about the rules of language. The only skill you need is being able to accurately predict the next word.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Peter Rahal, the 33-year-old energy bar impresario who sold RxBar to Kellogg for $600 million and became something of a consumer products legend in the process, stands in the gigantic, spotless kitchen of his new Miami Beach mansion. Behind him, floor-to-ceiling windows revealed his pool, his outdoor bar, and Sunset Harbour. Throughout the house are expensive-looking modernist metal chandeliers. The kitchen drawers are filled with gold utensils.
[‚Ä¶]
Rahal prides himself on struggle and says that‚Äôs how he built RxBar into a breakout success. Yet now he exists in a rich person‚Äôs wonderland, where workers appear and disappear on some imperceptible schedule to clean the pool or fix the elevator, where the kitchen‚Äôs surfaces are entirely smooth and glossy. The many contradictions now swirling in Rahal‚Äôs daily existence are not lost on him. ‚ÄúAs life moves forward,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúan easier life isn‚Äôt always a better life.‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fans who needed tickets stood out. We called them ‚Äústraights‚Äù because they stand straight up in a crowd protecting the cash they‚Äôre unused to carrying, hands stuck in their pockets, and you could make a few thousand dollars in a couple of hours if you knew how to spot them. The game was to sell your tickets for as much cash as the straights could cough up.</p>

  <p>I had 30 tickets left with 20 minutes to kickoff. If I didn‚Äôt sell them they‚Äôd be worthless ‚Äî deadwood. But with undercovers swarming the stadium, the risk of arrest swelled with every sale. Ticket scalping in Brazil carried a multi-year prison sentence, and I couldn‚Äôt speak Portuguese, so I had to be careful. Avoiding capture meant closing deals quickly and moving every five minutes. These were techniques my mentors taught me on street corners, outside the track at the Kentucky Derby, in the parking lots bordering the Masters, the hotel lobbies by the Super Bowl.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With an effortless motion, Davenport hits soaring rifle-shot irons that land like warm dumplings. Watching elite college athletes smash 6-irons and launch drives on gravity-defying lines is a mystifying experience. The speed, sound and sense of compression seem to defy physics. Most elite Division I players arrive on campus with all of this figured out, their swings more or less grooved to the current technology and requirements of modern tournament golf. They come to places like Vanderbilt and Texas because they want to compete and win titles, but also because they know the coaches there can help them realize their dream‚Äîa professional career‚Äîwhich is on the mind of virtually every college player, at least initially. They choose programs because there‚Äôs evidence of this, rosters of former players on the PGA Tour. The job of Limbaugh, Fields and their brethren, therefore, is to help these kids round out their games, to develop their competitive character and situational awareness. College coaching is largely, on a fundamental level, teaching course management and honing instincts beyond shooting yardages and firing at pins, which is what all exceptional 17-year-olds do.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The metaphysical explanation is that Roger Federer is one of those rare, preternatural athletes who appear to be exempt, at least in part, from certain physical laws. Good analogues here include Michael Jordan, who could not only jump inhumanly high but actually hang there a beat or two longer than gravity allows, and Muhammad Ali, who really could ‚Äúfloat‚Äù across the canvas and land two or three jabs in the clock-time required for one. There are probably a half-dozen other examples since 1960. And Federer is of this type ‚Äî a type that one could call genius, or mutant, or avatar. He is never hurried or off-balance. The approaching ball hangs, for him, a split-second longer than it ought to. His movements are lithe rather than athletic. Like Ali, Jordan, Maradona, and Gretzky, he seems both less and more substantial than the men he faces.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And what of James Bond‚Äôs watches? From a few clues in Fleming‚Äôs novels, we learn that 007 wears a ‚Äúheavy Rolex Oyster‚Äù of some sort, with a luminous dial and expanding metal bracelet. It was possibly an Explorer, the watch of the author himself, who no doubt wore it on his spearfishing excursions from his Jamaican beach villa. This was the 1950s, when steel Rolex sports watches were in their infancy and Bond treats his like the tool it was, not the luxury accessory or status symbol it would become. In the novel, On Her Majesty‚Äôs Secret Service, he brandishes it as a ‚Äúknuckle duster‚Äù, wrapping it across his fist to render a henchman unconscious in the ski room of a mountaintop hideout. Upon later reflection, Bond decides he can get his shattered watch replaced with a stipend from MI-6, and will probably get another Rolex, which Bond feels no particular affection for, but likes because they‚Äôre heavy and easy to read. No more, no less.</p>

  <p>The ground truth method relies on the frame-synchronized filming of a ball passing over the plate by two high-speed cameras. WSU uses Phantom cameras which operate at 2500 frames per second (fps). These 1920√ó1200 cameras are focused down to a field of view (FOV) of 5 x 3 ft on the space surrounding the strike zone as in Figure 2. This yields a spatial resolution of about 0.03 inches/pixel within the camera‚Äôs field depth. Exposure times of 50 ¬µs allow still images from video with a motion blur of less than 80 thousandths of an inch (&lt; 0.080‚Äù) as shown in Figure 3.</p>

  <p>For more than half a century, governments all over the world trusted a single company to keep the communications of their spies, soldiers and diplomats secret.</p>

  <p>The company, Crypto AG, got its first break with a contract to build code-making machines for U.S. troops during World War II. Flush with cash, it became a dominant maker of encryption devices for decades, navigating waves of technology from mechanical gears to electronic circuits and, finally, silicon chips and software.</p>

  <p>The Swiss firm made millions of dollars selling equipment to more than 120 countries well into the 21st century. Its clients included Iran, military juntas in Latin America, nuclear rivals India and Pakistan, and even the Vatican.</p>

  <p>But what none of its customers ever knew was that Crypto AG was secretly owned by the CIA in a highly classified partnership with West German intelligence. These spy agencies rigged the company‚Äôs devices so they could easily break the codes that countries used to send encrypted messages.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But on certain maps, in Switzerland‚Äôs more remote regions, there is also, curiously, a spider, a man‚Äôs face, a naked woman, a hiker, a fish, and a marmot. These barely-perceptible apparitions aren‚Äôt mistakes, but rather illustrations hidden by the official cartographers at Swisstopo in defiance of their mandate ‚Äúto reconstitute reality.‚Äù Maps published by Swisstopo undergo a rigorous proofreading process, so to find an illicit drawing means that the cartographer has outsmarted his colleagues.
[‚Ä¶]
Many maps also contain intentional errors to trap would-be copyright violators. The work of recording reality is particularly vulnerable to plagiarism: if a cartographer is suspected of copying another‚Äôs work, he can simply claim to be duplicating the real world‚Äî ideally, the two should be the same. Mapmakers often rely on fictitious streets, typically no longer than a block, to differentiate their accounts of the truth</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the past 10 years I‚Äôve been staring wide-eyed and with alarm as the sweet, gentle citizen restaurant transformed into a kind of unruly colossal beast. The food world got stranger and weirder to me right while I was deep in it. The ‚Äúwaiter‚Äù became the ‚Äúserver,‚Äù the ‚Äúrestaurant business‚Äù became the ‚Äúhospitality industry,‚Äù what used to be the ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù became the ‚Äúguest,‚Äù what was once your ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù became your ‚Äúbrand,‚Äù the small acts of kindness and the way you always used to have of sharing your talents and looking out for others became things to ‚Äúmonetize.‚Äù</p>

  <p>The work itself ‚Äî cooking delicious, interesting food and cleaning up after cooking it ‚Äî still feels as fresh and honest and immensely satisfying as ever. Our beloved regulars and the people who work so hard at Prune are all still my favorite people on earth. But maybe it‚Äôs the bloat, the fetishistic foodies, the new demographic of my city who have never been forced to work in retail or service sectors. Maybe it‚Äôs the auxiliary industries that feed off the restaurants themselves ‚Äî the bloggers and agents and the ‚Äúinfluencers,‚Äù the brand managers, the personal assistants hired just to keep you fresh on ‚ÄúInsta,‚Äù the Food &amp; Wine festivals, the multitude of panels we chefs are now routinely invited to join, to offer our charming yet thoroughly unresearched opinions on. The proliferation of television shows and YouTube channels and culinary competitions and season after season of programming where you find yourself aghast to see an idol of yours stuffing packaged cinnamon buns into a football-shaped baking pan and squirting the frosting into a laces pattern for a tailgating episode on the Food Network.</p>

  <p>And God, the brunch, the brunch. The phone hauled out for every single pancake and every single Bloody Mary to be photographed and Instagrammed. That guy who strolls in and won‚Äôt remove his sunglasses as he holds up two fingers at my hostess without saying a word: He wants a table for two. The purebred lap dogs now passed off as service animals to calm the anxieties that might arise from eating eggs Benedict on a Sunday afternoon. I want the girl who called the first day of our mandated shut down to call back, in however many months when restaurants are allowed to reopen, so I can tell her with delight and sincerity: No. We are not open for brunch. There is no more brunch.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What makes you you? The question cuts to the core of who we are, the things that make us special in this universe. The converse of the question raises another kind of philosophical dilemma: If a person isn‚Äôt himself, who is he?</p>

  <p>Countless philosophers have taken a swing at this elusive pi√±ata. In the 17th century, John Locke pinned selfhood on memory, using recollections as the thread connecting a person‚Äôs past with their present. That holds some intuitive appeal: Memory, after all, is how most of us register our continued existence. But memory is unreliable. Writing in the 1970s, renowned philosopher Derek Parfit recast Locke‚Äôs idea to argue that personhood emerges from a more complex view of psychological connectedness across time. He suggested that a host of mental phenomena‚Äîmemories, intentions, beliefs, and so on‚Äîforge chains that bind us to our past selves. A person today has many of the same psychological states as that person a day ago. Yesterday‚Äôs human enjoys similar overlap with an individual of two days prior. Each memory or belief is a chain that stretches back through time, holding a person together in the face of inevitable flux.</p>

  <p>The gist, then, is that someone is ‚Äúhimself‚Äù because countless mental artifacts stay firm from one day to the next, anchoring that person‚Äôs character over time. It‚Äôs a less crisp definition than the old idea of a soul, offering no firm threshold where selfhood breaks down. It doesn‚Äôt pinpoint, for example, how many psychological chains you can lose before you stop being yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In today‚Äôs world of fear and unease and social distancing, it‚Äôs hard to imagine sharing experiences like these ever again. I don‚Äôt know when it will be safe to return to singing arm in arm at the top of our lungs, hearts racing, bodies moving, souls bursting with life. But I do know that we will do it again, because we have to. It‚Äôs not a choice. We‚Äôre human. We need moments that reassure us that we are not alone. That we are understood. That we are imperfect. And, most important, that we need each other. I have shared my music, my words, my life with the people who come to our shows. And they have shared their voices with me. Without that audience‚Äîthat screaming, sweating audience‚Äîmy songs would only be sound. But together, we are instruments in a sonic cathedral, one that we build together night after night. And one that we will surely build again.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúLook, winning has a price,‚Äù says Jordan. ‚ÄúAnd leadership has a price. So I pulled people along when they didn‚Äôt want to be pulled. I challenged people when they didn‚Äôt want to be challenged. And I earned that right because my teammates who came after me didn‚Äôt endure all the things that I endured. Once you joined the team, you lived at a certain standard that I played the game. And I wasn‚Äôt going to take any less. Now if that means I had to go in there and get in your ass a little bit, then I did that. You ask all my teammates. The one thing about Michael Jordan was he never asked me to do something that he didn‚Äôt fucking do. When people see this they are going say, ‚ÄòWell he wasn‚Äôt really a nice guy. He may have been a tyrant.‚Äô Well, that‚Äôs you. Because you never won anything. I wanted to win, but I wanted them to win to be a part of that as well. Look, I don‚Äôt have to do this. I am only doing it because it is who I am. That‚Äôs how I played the game. That was my mentality. If you don‚Äôt want to play that way, don‚Äôt play that way. Break.‚Äù</p>

  <p>And so what I believe is that having a daughter does not make a man decent. Having a wife does not make a decent man. Treating people with dignity and respect makes a decent man, and when a decent man messes up as we all are bound to do, he tries his best and does apologize. Not to save face, not to win a vote, he apologizes genuinely to repair and acknowledge the harm done so that we can all move on.</p>

  <p>Lastly, what I want to express to Mr. Yoho is gratitude. <strong>I want to thank him for showing the world that you can be a powerful man and accost women. You can have daughters and accost women without remorse. You can be married and accost women. You can take photos and project an image to the world of being a family man and accost women without remorse and with a sense of impunity.</strong> It happens every day in this country. It happened here on the steps of our nation‚Äôs Capitol.

  <p>Between a high, solid wall and an egg that breaks against it, I will always stand on the side of the egg.‚Äù</p>

  <p>Yes, no matter how right the wall may be and how wrong the egg, I will stand with the egg. Someone else will have to decide what is right and what is wrong; perhaps time or history will decide. If there were a novelist who, for whatever reason, wrote works standing with the wall, of what value would such works be?</p>

  <p>What is the meaning of this metaphor? In some cases, it is all too simple and clear. Bombers and tanks and rockets and white phosphorus shells are that high, solid wall. The eggs are the unarmed civilians who are crushed and burned and shot by them. This is one meaning of the metaphor.</p>

  <p>This is not all, though. It carries a deeper meaning. Think of it this way. Each of us is, more or less, an egg. Each of us is a unique, irreplaceable soul enclosed in a fragile shell. This is true of me, and it is true of each of you. And each of us, to a greater or lesser degree, is confronting a high, solid wall. The wall has a name: It is The System. The System is supposed to protect us, but sometimes it takes on a life of its own, and then it begins to kill us and cause us to kill others ‚Äî coldly, efficiently, systematically.</p>

  <p>‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the point of it all?‚Äù
‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúSeriously? You‚Äôre asking me for the meaning of life? Isn‚Äôt that a little stereotypical?‚Äù
‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs a reasonable question,‚Äù you persisted.
I looked you in the eye. ‚ÄúThe meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou mean mankind? You want us to mature?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.‚Äù
‚ÄúJust me? What about everyone else?‚Äù
‚ÄúThere is no one else,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIn this universe, there‚Äôs just you and me.‚Äù
You stared blankly at me. ‚ÄúBut all the people on earth‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúAll you. Different incarnations of you.‚Äù
‚ÄúWait. I‚Äôm everyone!?‚Äù
‚ÄúNow you‚Äôre getting it,‚Äù
‚Ä¶
‚ÄúOnce you‚Äôve lived every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be born.‚Äù</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.theringer.com/mlb/2019/8/9/20798375/umpire-perfect-game-accurate-robo-umps">this article by The Ringer</a>, no Umpire has ever called a perfect game behind home plate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Plug all these into a Bayesian formula, and out comes the answer: the posterior probability that we are living in base reality is almost the same as the posterior probability that we are a simulation‚Äîwith the odds tilting in favor of base reality by just a smidgen.</p>

  <p>These probabilities would change dramatically if humans created a simulation with conscious beings inside it, because such an event would change the chances that we previously assigned to the physical hypothesis. ‚ÄúYou can just exclude that hypothesis right off the bat. Then you are only left with the simulation hypothesis,‚Äù Kipping says. ‚ÄúThe day we invent that technology, it flips the odds from a little bit better than 50‚Äì50 that we are real to almost certainly we are not real, according to these calculations. <strong>It‚Äôd be a very strange celebration of our genius that day.</strong>‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The script for Casino Royale worried director Martin Campbell. This was his second reboot of the James Bond franchise, and on the cusp of production, he realized the movie‚Äôs centerpiece ‚Äî a showdown between 007 and the blood-eyed villain Le Chiffre ‚Äî took place around a quiet poker table. Loosely adapting Ian Fleming‚Äôs 1953 novel of the same name, screenwriters Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis had replaced the author‚Äôs original game of baccarat with three big rounds of Texas hold‚Äôem. The card game, they believed, made for better drama ‚Äî it was known more widely, required more skill and delivered higher stakes. But for Campbell, who had never picked up a deck, it looked like a snooze.
[‚Ä¶]
Ultimately, only three hands matter in Casino Royale, and they all feature showdowns between Bond and LeChiffre, providing a three-act structure to the heart of the movie. The first watches Bond muck his cards and intentionally lose to discover LeChiffre‚Äôs tell; the second watches LeChiffre dupe Bond and eliminate him from the table with quad jacks; and the third watches Bond return to the tournament to redeem himself with a straight flush. In between, Bond spends a drink break by suffocating two assassins in a stairwell and, at a later intermission, survives a poisoned drink after Vesper (Eva Green), his British accomplice, defibrillates him with his life hanging in the balance.</p>
