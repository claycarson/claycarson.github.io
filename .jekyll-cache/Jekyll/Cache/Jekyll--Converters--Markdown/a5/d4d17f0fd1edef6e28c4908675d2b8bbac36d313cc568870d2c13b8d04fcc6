  <p>Itâ€™s the kind of job where you canâ€™t just wear 10 different hats, you have to make the hats yourself. So youâ€™re juggling constant projects and design work and construction work and repair work. You show up in the morning and you have to make sure that the whole theme park is safeâ€”all the LEGO models are intact, thereâ€™s nothing broken, nothingâ€™s going to fall down. And from there weâ€™ll start to work on any repairs that they need done, or weâ€™ll work on designing new models using computer software or using pencil and paper, or just building it from bricks.</p>

  <p>Toward the end of the day weâ€™ll start building those models, and the design process is really either up to us or up to other LEGO Master Model Builders at other LEGOLAND parks. We share designs all the time, weâ€™ll share construction and things like that. So itâ€™s different depending on every single project, and every single project has a story behind it.</p>
