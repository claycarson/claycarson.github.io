I"†#<p>This newsletter is a collection of things I have found in the last month that I enjoyed, found interesting, or simply wanted to share.</p>

<p>You can follow me more closely at <a href="http://claycarson.net" title="Personal Website">my personal website</a> or if you or someone you know is looking to buy or sell a home, you can point them to <a href="http://claycarson.com" title="Business Website ">my real estate website</a>.</p>

<h2>Announcement</h2>

<blockquote>
  Tending this website keeps me sane. I think of it as a digital garden, a kind of sanctuary. I recognize this in Ethan Marcotte‚Äôs eloquent suggestion that we ‚Äúlet a website be a worry stone.‚Äù And if my site is a kind of garden, then I see myself as both gardener and architect, in so much as I make plans and prepare the ground, then sow things that grow in all directions. Some things die, but others thrive, and that‚Äôs how my garden grows. And I tend it for me; visitors are a bonus. ‚Äî Simon Collison

<li>I‚Äôd invite you to check out the <a href="https://claycarson.net" title="Clay Carson">redesigned website</a>. I suppose the only real excitement is the <a href="https://claycarson.net/timeline" title="Clay Carson Timeline">timeline</a>. For some time now, and increasingly in the future, I have been and will be tracking movies, tv shows, books, quotes, thoughts, photos, and travels (RIP <em>&#42;sobbing&#42;</em>).

I think the details behind the <a href="https://claycarson.net/timeline" title="Clay Carson Timeline">timeline</a> are kind of cool. I use <a href="http://airtable.com" title="Airtable">Airtable</a> and <a href="http://zapier.com" title="Zapier">Zapier</a> to create new posts. All I have to do is update the spreadsheets I already use to track everything and a new post is created on the site.

If you see something weird or that doesn‚Äôt look right, <a href="mailto:clay@claycarson.net" title="please let me know">please let me know</a>. I‚Äôll add it to my list.&lt;/p&gt;</li>

<li>The newsletter is moving from being self-hosted to <a href="https://mailchimp.com">Mailchimp</a>. You might see a welcome or confirmation email, or if things go horribly (horribly, horribly) wrong you might need to opt-in again. We‚Äôll cross that bridge if we come to it.&lt;/p&gt;</li>
</ol>

<p>And now, as we were‚Ä¶</p>

<h2>‚Äú...rip your individual cells apart‚Äù <span class="small"><em>&#42; blink, blink &#42;</em></span></h2>

<blockquote>
  In order to approach the actual event horizon itself, you‚Äôd have to somehow shield yourself from these tidal forces, which would rip your individual cells apart and even the individual atoms and molecules composing you before you crossed the event horizon. This stretching effect along one direction while compressing you along the other is known as spaghettification, and it‚Äôs how black holes would kill and tear apart any creature that ventured too close to an event horizon where space was too severely curved.
  
  As spectacular as falling into a black hole would actually be, if Earth spontaneously became one, you‚Äôd never get to experience it for yourself. You‚Äôd get to live for about another 21 minutes in an incredibly odd state: free-falling, while the air around you free-fell at exactly the same rate. As time went on, you‚Äôd feel the atmosphere thicken and the air pressure increase as everything around the world accelerated towards the center, while objects that weren‚Äôt attached to the ground would appear approach you from all directions.
  
  But as you approached the center and you sped up, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to feel your motion through space. Instead, what you‚Äôd begin to feel was an uncomfortable tidal force, as though the individual constituent components of your body were being stretched internally. These spaghettifying forces would distort your body into a noodle-like shape, causing you pain, loss of consciousness, death, and then your corpse would be atomized. In the end, like everything on Earth, we‚Äôd be absorbed into the black hole, simply adding to its mass ever so slightly. For the final 21 minutes of everyone‚Äôs life, under only the laws of gravity, our demises would all truly be equal.

<blockquote>
  The captain of the container vessel would regularly receive automated emails telling him to slow down the ship. It‚Äôs impossible to know why the shipping company‚Äôs algorithms decided this was for the best ‚Äî the captain himself didn‚Äôt know. But he could speculate: Maybe the staff or systems at the terminal ahead reported delays with off-loading, or a mechanical hitch. Or maybe the algorithm saw the delays coming in advance because the GPS trackers on other containers showed delivery trucks stuck in gridlock outside the port. Maybe it decided to slow everything down because a customer de-prioritized their order. Or that a change somewhere else in another link of the supply chain meant that getting their shipment from another source became a cheaper or quicker option. Or the cost of oil fluctuated just enough that burning it at the ship‚Äôs current rate became inefficient. Or maybe it was all of these reasons simultaneously, or none of them. The point is that we don‚Äôt know, the captain of the ship itself didn‚Äôt know, and that nobody may know ‚Äî but that didn‚Äôt stop the decision being made.

<blockquote>
  My hunt for the lost McRecipe took me up the corporate ladder and to obsessive corners of Reddit. I spoke to fast-food experts, super-fan museum curators, and a 79-year-old former employee of the very first McDonald‚Äôs. After weeks of digging, I procured a recipe for the original fries that one fast-food historian believes to be the real deal, one I recreated several times to ensure its legitimacy. I sweat over hot tallow, bled from cutting perfect shoestrings, and literally got pulverized salt in those wounds. But according to at least one expert, I have reason to believe the recipe I‚Äôve uncovered is authentic.
