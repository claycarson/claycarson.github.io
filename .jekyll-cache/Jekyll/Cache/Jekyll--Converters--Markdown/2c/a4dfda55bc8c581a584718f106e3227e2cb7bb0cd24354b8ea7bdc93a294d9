  <p>Accordingly, the state has not just four sides, but a total of 697 sides. So if Colorado is not a rectangle, what is it? Well, not a pentagon, (Greek for 5-sider), hexagon (6-sider) or a heptagon (7-sider), but a â€” hold on to something â€” hexahectaenneacontakaiheptagon (697-sider).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The script for Casino Royale worried director Martin Campbell. This was his second reboot of the James Bond franchise, and on the cusp of production, he realized the movieâ€™s centerpiece â€” a showdown between 007 and the blood-eyed villain Le Chiffre â€” took place around a quiet poker table. Loosely adapting Ian Flemingâ€™s 1953 novel of the same name, screenwriters Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis had replaced the authorâ€™s original game of baccarat with three big rounds of Texas holdâ€™em. The card game, they believed, made for better drama â€” it was known more widely, required more skill and delivered higher stakes. But for Campbell, who had never picked up a deck, it looked like a snooze.
[â€¦]
Ultimately, only three hands matter in Casino Royale, and they all feature showdowns between Bond and LeChiffre, providing a three-act structure to the heart of the movie. The first watches Bond muck his cards and intentionally lose to discover LeChiffreâ€™s tell; the second watches LeChiffre dupe Bond and eliminate him from the table with quad jacks; and the third watches Bond return to the tournament to redeem himself with a straight flush. In between, Bond spends a drink break by suffocating two assassins in a stairwell and, at a later intermission, survives a poisoned drink after Vesper (Eva Green), his British accomplice, defibrillates him with his life hanging in the balance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yak Shaving is the last step of a series of steps that occurs when you find something you need to do.</p>

  <p>â€œI want to wax the car today.â€</p>

  <p>â€œOops, the hose is still broken from the winter. Iâ€™ll need to buy a new one at Home Depot.â€</p>

  <p>â€œBut Home Depot is on the other side of the Tappan Zee bridge and getting there without my EZPass is miserable because of the tolls.â€</p>

  <p>â€œBut, wait! I could borrow my neighborâ€™s EZPassâ€¦â€</p>

  <p>â€œBob wonâ€™t lend me his EZPass until I return the mooshi pillow my son borrowed, though.â€</p>

  <p>â€œAnd we havenâ€™t returned it because some of the stuffing fell out and we need to get some yak hair to restuff it.â€</p>

  <p>And the next thing you know, youâ€™re at the zoo, shaving a yak, all so you can wax your car.</p>
