  <p>If you take 1 divided by 243 you get .004115226337â€¦ Itâ€™s quite cute: It goes a little cockeyed after 559 when youâ€™re carrying but it soon straightens itself out and repeats itself nicely. I thought it was kind of amusing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I had this uneasy feeling of â€œIâ€™m not adequate,â€ until finally I said to myself, â€œIâ€™m gonna stop, and read one sentence slowly, so I can figure out what the hell it means.â€ So I stoppedâ€”at randomâ€”and read the next sentence very carefully. I canâ€™t remember it precisely, but it was very close to this: â€œThe individual member of the social community often receives his information via visual, symbolic channels.â€ I went back and forth over it, and translated. You know what it means? â€œPeople read.â€</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think the educational and psychological studies I mentioned are examples of what I would like to call cargo cult science. In the South Seas there is a cargo cult of people. During the war they saw airplanes land with lots of good materials, and they want the same thing to happen now. So theyâ€™ve arranged to make things like runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head like headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennasâ€”heâ€™s the controllerâ€”and they wait for the airplanes to land. Theyâ€™re doing everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked before. But it doesnâ€™t work. No airplanes land. So I call these things cargo cult science, because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of scientific investigation, but theyâ€™re missing something essential, because the planes donâ€™t land.</p>
