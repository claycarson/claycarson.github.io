I"<p>I collect quotes like trading cards. I don’t have a strong criteria for inclusion in this list: if the
quote was remarkable in any way (a clever turn of phrase, an interesting concept, a pithy aphorism,
a useful insight, a beautiful piece of diction) I’ll add it here. At some point I might try and 
make this entire enterprise a little more organize with tags and such, but that seems unnecessary
while the number of quotes is still less than a thousand: it is hard to displace the ergonomics of Command &amp; F.</p>
