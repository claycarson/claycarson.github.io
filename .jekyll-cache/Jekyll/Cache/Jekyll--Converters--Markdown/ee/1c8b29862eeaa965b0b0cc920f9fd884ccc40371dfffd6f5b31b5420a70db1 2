<blockquote>
  <p>Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It‚Äôs not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>On any given day, you may struggle with your habits because you‚Äôre too busy or too tired or too overwhelmed or hundreds of other reasons. Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way. This is why you can‚Äôt get too attached to one version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, decide who you want to be. This holds at any level‚Äîas an individual, as a team, as a community, as a nation. What do you want to stand for? What are your principles and values? Who do you wish to become?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your identity is not set in stone. You have a choice in every moment. You can choose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today. And this brings us to the deeper purpose of this book and the real reason habits matter.</p>

<h3 id="7-the-secret-to-self-control">7: The Secret to Self-Control</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals aren‚Äôt all that different from those who are struggling. Instead, ‚Äúdisciplined‚Äù people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment.</p>

<h3 id="8-how-to-make-a-habit-irresistible">8: How to Make a Habit Irresistible</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them. The wanting centers in the brain are large: the brain stem, the nucleus accumbens, the ventral tegmental area, the dorsal striatum, the amygdala, and portions of the prefrontal cortex. By comparison, the liking centers of the brain are much smaller. They are often referred to as ‚Äúhedonic hot spots‚Äù and are distributed like tiny islands throughout the brain. For instance, researchers have found that 100 percent of the nucleus accumbens is activated during wanting. Meanwhile, only 10 percent of the structure is activated during liking. The fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to the regions responsible for craving and desire provides further evidence of the crucial role these processes play. Desire is the engine that drives behavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response.</p>

  <p>One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your culture sets your expectation for what is ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself. You‚Äôll rise together.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trying to pump up your motivation to stick with a hard habit is like trying to force water through a bent hose. You can do it, but it requires a lot of effort and increases the tension in your life. Meanwhile, making your habits simple and easy is like removing the bend in the hose. Rather than trying to overcome the friction in your life, you reduce it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Researchers estimate that 40 to 50 percent of our actions on any given day are done out of habit. This is already a substantial percentage, but the true influence of your habits is even greater than these numbers suggest. Habits are automatic choices that influence the conscious decisions that follow. Yes, a habit can be completed in just a few seconds, but it can also shape the actions that you take for minutes or hours afterward.</p>

  <p>Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly. The breaking of a habit doesn‚Äôt matter if the reclaiming of it is fast.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is sometimes referred to as Goodhart‚Äôs Law. Named after the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, ‚ÄúWhen a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.‚Äù Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in the overall system.</p>

  <p>While there is still much to learn, one of the most consistent findings is that the way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks of ‚Äújust manageable difficulty.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the difference between the best athletes and everyone else?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhat do the really successful people do that most don‚Äôt?‚Äù He mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent.

<blockquote>
  <p>In the words of investor Paul Graham, ‚Äúkeep your identity small.‚Äù The more you let a single belief define you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Habits deliver numerous benefits, but the downside is that they can lock us into our previous patterns of thinking and acting‚Äîeven when the world is shifting around us. Everything is impermanent. Life is constantly changing, so you need to periodically check in to see if your old habits and beliefs are still serving you.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-the-secret-to-results-that-last">Conclusion: The Secret to Results That Last</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the beginning, small improvements can often seem meaningless because they get washed away by the weight of the system. Just as one coin won‚Äôt make you rich, one positive change like meditating for one minute or reading one page each day is unlikely to deliver a noticeable difference. Gradually, though, as you continue to layer small changes on top of one another, the scales of life start to move. Each improvement is like adding a grain of sand to the positive side of the scale, slowly tilting things in your favor. Eventually, if you stick with it, you hit a tipping point. Suddenly, it feels easier to stick with good habits. The weight of the system is working for you rather than against you.</p>
