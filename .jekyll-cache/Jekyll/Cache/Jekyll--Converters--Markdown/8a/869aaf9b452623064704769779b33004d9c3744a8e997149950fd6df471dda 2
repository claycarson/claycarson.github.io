  <p>He meant that we all have ticking away within us something we fear will badly harm our reputation if it got outâ€”some â€œIâ€™m glad Iâ€™m not thatâ€ at the end of an â€œIâ€™m glad Iâ€™m not me.â€ I think he was right. Maybe our secret is actually nothing horrendous. Maybe nobody would even consider it a big deal if it was exposed. But we canâ€™t take that risk. So we keep it buried. Maybe itâ€™s a work impropriety. Or maybe itâ€™s just a feeling that at any moment weâ€™ll blurt something out during some important meeting thatâ€™ll prove to everyone that we arenâ€™t proper professional people or, in fact, functional human beings.</p>

  <p>I once asked a car-crash victim what it had felt like to be in a smashup. She said her eeriest memory was how one second the car was her friend, working for her, its contours designed to fit her body perfectly, everything smooth and sleek and luxurious, and then a blink of an eye later it had become a jagged weapon of tortureâ€”like she was inside an iron maiden. Her friend had become her worst enemy.</p>

  <p>I think we all care deeply about things that seem totally inconsequential to other people. We all carry around with us the flotsam and jetsam of perceived humiliations that actually mean nothing. We are a mass of vulnerabilities, and who knows what will trigger them?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It may be somewhat paradoxical to refer to shame as a â€œfeeling,â€ for while shame is initially painful, constant shaming leads to a deadening of feeling. Shame, like cold, is, in essence, the absence of warmth. And when it reaches overwhelming intensity, shame is experienced, like cold, as a feeling of numbness and deadness. <a href="#">In Danteâ€™s Inferno</a> the lowest circle of hell was a region not of flames, but of iceâ€”absolute coldness. â€”JAMES GILLIGAN, Violence: Reflections on Our Deadliest Epidemic</p>
