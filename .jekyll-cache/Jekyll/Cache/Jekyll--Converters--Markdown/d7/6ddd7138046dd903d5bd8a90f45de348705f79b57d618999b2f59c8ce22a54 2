  <p>In the beginning there was faithâ€”which is. Childish; trustâ€”which is vain; and illusionâ€”which is dangerous.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To forget would be not only dangerous but offensive; to forget the dead would be akin to killing them a second time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was nothing but a bodyâ€¦The stomach alone was measuring time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Behind me, I heard the same man asking:
â€œFor Godâ€™s sake, where is God?â€
And from within me, I heard a voice answer:
â€œWhere He is? This is whereâ€”hanging here from this gallowsâ€¦â€</p>
