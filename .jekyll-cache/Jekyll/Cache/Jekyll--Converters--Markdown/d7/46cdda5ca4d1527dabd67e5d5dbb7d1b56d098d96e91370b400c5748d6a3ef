I"ı<p>I collect quotes like trading cards. I don‚Äôt have a strong criteria for inclusion in this list: if the
quote was remarkable in any way (a clever turn of phrase, an interesting concept, a pithy aphorism,
a useful insight, a beautiful piece of diction) I‚Äôll add it here. At some point I might try and 
make this entire enterprise a little more organize with tags and such, but that seems unnecessary
while the number of quotes is still less than a thousand: it is hard to displace the ergonomics of Command &amp; F.</p>

         <p>In the beginning, small improvements can often seem meaningless because they get washed away by the weight of the system. Just as one coin won‚Äôt make you rich, one positive change like meditating for one minute or reading one page each day is unlikely to deliver a noticeable difference. Gradually, though, as you continue to layer small changes on top of one another, the scales of life start to move. Each improvement is like adding a grain of sand to the positive side of the scale, slowly tilting things in your favor. Eventually, if you stick with it, you hit a tipping point. Suddenly, it feels easier to stick with good habits. The weight of the system is working for you rather than against you.</p>

         <p>Onitsuka asked what we thought [new shoe] should be called. Bowerman liked ‚ÄúAztec,‚Äù in homage to the 1968 Olympics, which were being held in Mexico City. I liked that, too. Fine, Onitsuka said.</p>

<p>The Aztec was born. And then Adidas threatened to sue. Adidas already had a new shoe named the ‚ÄúAzteca Gold,‚Äù a track spike they were planning to introduce at the same Olympics. No one had ever heard of it, but that didn‚Äôt stop Adidas from kicking up a fuss.</p>

<p>Aggravated, I drove up the mountain to Bowerman‚Äôs house to talk it all over. We sat on the wide porch, looking down at the river. It sparkled that day like a silver shoelace. He took off his ball cap, put it on again, rubbed his face. ‚ÄúWho was that guy who kicked the shit out of the Aztecs?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúCortez,‚Äù I said. He grunted. ‚ÄúOkay. Let‚Äôs call it the Cortez.‚Äù</p>
