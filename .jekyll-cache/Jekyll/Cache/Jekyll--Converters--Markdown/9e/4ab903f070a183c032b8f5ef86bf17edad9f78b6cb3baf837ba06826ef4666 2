<blockquote>
  <p>Itâ€™s not difficult to piece it together: With a video camera rolling, Richard would launch the balloon and freak out. Heâ€™d call the FAA and get the balloon tracked. Thereâ€™d be a tearful reunion when Falcon emerged from the basement, where heâ€™d been told to hide. Richard would call back and say his son wasnâ€™t in the basket. Theyâ€™d make sure the Fort Collins newspaper knew about the stray saucer and the drama behind it. The story might go nationwide. With publicity in full force and a recording of every moment, networks would fight over the Heenesâ€™ story.</p>

  <p>Except Falcon didnâ€™t hide where he was told to. He hid in the garage attic, not in the basement. He played with his cars and he fell asleep. The FAA said Richard needed to call 911. Deputies showed up. Neighbors began searching for Falcon. And then that silvery balloon was careening across our television screens. Thatâ€™s why Mayumiâ€™s reunion with Falcon was so believable: For a few hours, she and Richard honestly worried their son had been swept away.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 2004, winner Rustam Kasimdzhanov walked away from the six-game world championship having lost 17 pounds. In October 2018, Polar, a U.S.-based company that tracks heart rates, monitored chess players during a tournament and found that 21-year-old Russian grandmaster Mikhail Antipov had burned 560 calories in two hours of sitting and playing chess â€“ or roughly what Roger Federer would burn in an hour of singles tennis.</p>
