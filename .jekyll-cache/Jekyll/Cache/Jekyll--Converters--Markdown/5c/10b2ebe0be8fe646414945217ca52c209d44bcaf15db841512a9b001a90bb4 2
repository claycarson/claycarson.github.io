  <p>The few things I have that have passed a half-century or more come in two categories. Either keepsakes like photos of my ancestors or my fatherâ€™s Army medals. Or tools. Virtually all of them hand tools, because there is nothing wrong with a century-old hammer or screwdriver. (And if they havenâ€™t broken yet, theyâ€™re not likely to.) But I do have one curiosity. An old electric hair clipper.</p>
