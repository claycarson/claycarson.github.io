<blockquote>
  <p>Prisoners take apart beard trimmers or CD players to get at the tiny motor, which they can adapt to make the tattoo needle go up and down quickly enough.</p>

  <p>The needle itself is often made from a metal guitar string split in two by holding it over an open flame until it snaps in half, creating a fine point. The springs inside gel pens can also flatten into needles.</p>

  <p>One former prisoner who now runs a tattoo shop said he used to make black ink by trapping soot in a milk carton placed over a burning pile of plastic razors or Bible pages. He would mix the leftover ash and soot with a bit of alcohol (for hygienic purposes).</p>

<p><a href="https://apolloinrealtime.org/11/">Apollo 11 in Real Time</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This website replays the Apollo 11 mission as it happened, 50 years ago. It consists entirely of historical material, all timed to Ground Elapsed Timeâ€“the master mission clock. Footage of Mission Control, film shot by the astronauts, and television broadcasts transmitted from space and the surface of the Moon, have been painstakingly placed to the very moments they were shot during the mission, as has every photograph taken, and every word spoken.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That car horn beeps an F major chord, this kettleâ€™s in A flat, some bedside lights get thrown out because they are out of tune with other appliancesâ€¦bath taps squeak in E, this person sneezes in E flat. That printerâ€™s in D mostly. The microwave is in the same key as the washing machine.
[â€¦]
When I taste things, I also hear music, mainly chords â€“ sugar and desserts almost always in major key and chocolate and coffee are particularly complex sounds, with overtones and harmonics. I love broccoli and cauliflower which are a cycle of fifths. Sushi tastes like power chords on an acoustic guitar. Lemon meringue pie is a concoction of A major chords and inversions, 7ths and minors.</p>
