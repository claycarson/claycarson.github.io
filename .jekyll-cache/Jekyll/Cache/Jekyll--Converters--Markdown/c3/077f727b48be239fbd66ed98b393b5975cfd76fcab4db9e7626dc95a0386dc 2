<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone knew that the US Department of Justice and Attorney General Barr would release the Mueller Report as a PDF file.</p>

  <p>In fact, it’s safe to say that AG Barr never considered delivering anything else. No one would have even suggested a Word file, or a set of TIFF images, or a website, or an XPS file, or EPUB, or plain text. It’s 2019, but it seems safe to say that they simply assumed they’d use PDF.</p>

  <p>If you are like most people, you simply assumed it would be a PDF as well.</p>

  <p>Why?</p>

  <p>On every swing a battle raged between his technical proficiency and mental fragility. He would stand over the ball, his mind jumbled with swing thoughts. His hands strangled the grip, his arms were knots of tension. The seconds would tick by, and he felt powerless to lift the club. Then the uncertainty would ebb just long enough to allow him to start his swing, and the resulting shot would be flawless.</p>
