  <p>â€œBack in the day, we had to create everything by hand,â€ Nintendo designer Takashi Tezuka said in a video released as part of Nintendoâ€™s E3 announcement Tuesday. Every square of land, question-mark block and Goomba had to be hand-drawn and colored on graph paper. When they were happy with the design, they sent it off to a developer to code. Fixing errors or making changes was tricky. Shigeru Miyamoto, Marioâ€™s creator, said whiting out mistakes was too messy, so they overlaid opaque tracing paper on top of the level being drawn.</p>
