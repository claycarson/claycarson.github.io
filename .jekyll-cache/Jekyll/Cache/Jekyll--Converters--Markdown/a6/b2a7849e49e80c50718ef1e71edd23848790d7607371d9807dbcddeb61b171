<blockquote>
  <p>I’m a big believer that you have to carve some time out of each day to do the things you love to do. It’s my own rule that I call the “three-hour rule.” You take three hours a day for yourself to do what YOU want to do. That time is cumulative. It can be going for a walk, watching TV, reading, whatever. But when you’re in that time you don’t feel guilty that you’re not with your family, at work, or doing something else. If you don’t take time for yourself—you’ll resent the people who are taking those things away from you.</p>

  <p>In a way though it’s good as it’s forced me to pay close attention and figure it out on my own. They say that’s the best way to learn. My wife always tells her employees, “If nobody told you how to do your job, how would you do it?” The results she gets from that are amazing. Sometimes you have to rip up the playbook, break the mold, and do it your own way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After the chanting and reflections around Jesus, today’s theme for service was forgiveness. It’s something I struggle with. It’s not that I live with a lot of resentments, but I have a hard time of letting go when I feel like I’ve been wronged or betrayed. So it really hit home when Brother Christopher explained that forgiveness was the answer to wasted energy. I really got it. But I’m still pissed at a few people.</p>

  <p>The checklist behind a Krav Maga first strike boils down to three basic elements: One, has someone violated your space? Two, is there a direct threat? And, three, get them before they get you. Sounds reasonable—right?</p>
