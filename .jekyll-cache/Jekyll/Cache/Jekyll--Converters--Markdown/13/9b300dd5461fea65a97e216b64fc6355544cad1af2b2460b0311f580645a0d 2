  <p>Backyards often benefit from showcasing the lawn. In these cases I tend to shoot at about waist to chest high.</p>

  <p>Pools benefit from a variety of camera heights. Nine times out of ten you can shoot at eye level and be fine.</p>

  <p>Standard Preprocessing I use these settings in most of my exterior presets.</p>

  <p>If it is a still night, then ISO 100 or 200 would be fine, allowing you to shoot time-exposures between 1-5 seconds most of the time. If there is a breeze though, then it’s best to bump up your ISO, thus allowing you to use a faster shutter speed to avoid blur of trees, bushes, etc.</p>

  <p>Using a preset in Lightroom you can turn a well-timed twilight shot</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you shot your twilight too early and you didn’t get an interior orange glow, there is a fairly simple fix, assuming you shot in brackets with multiple exposures. This will require some drastic changes to your settings, so in this case I recommend importing your RAW files directly into Lightroom instead of using OEM software to first convert to TIFFs.</p>
