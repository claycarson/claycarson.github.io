  <p>The orator Demosthenes once said that virtue begins with understanding and is fulfilled by courage.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Aristotle‚Äôs famous Ethics, he uses the analogy of a warped piece of wood to describe human nature. In order to eliminate warping or curvature, a skilled woodworker slowly applies pressure in the opposite direction‚Äîessentially, bending it straight.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>The ego we see most commonly goes by a more casual definition: an unhealthy belief in our own importance. Arrogance. Self-centered ambition.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The need to be better than, more than, recognized for, far past any reasonable utility‚Äîthat‚Äôs ego. It‚Äôs the sense of superiority and certainty that exceeds the bounds of confidence and talent.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ego is the voice that tells us we‚Äôre better than we really are, we can say ego inhibits true success by preventing a direct and honest connection to the world around us.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we remove ego, we‚Äôre left with what is real. What replaces ego is humility, yes‚Äîbut rock-hard humility and confidence. Whereas ego is artificial, this type of confidence can hold weight. Ego is stolen. Confidence is earned. Ego is self-anointed, its swagger is artifice. One is girding yourself, the other gas-lighting. It‚Äôs the difference between potent and poisonous.</p>

<h2 id="part-i-aspire">PART I: ASPIRE</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>He wanted him to ‚ÄúBe affable in your relations with those who approach you, and never haughty; for the pride of the arrogant even slaves can hardly endure‚Äù and ‚ÄúBe slow in deliberation, but be prompt to carry out your resolves‚Äù and that the ‚Äúbest thing which we have in ourselves is good judgment.‚Äù Constantly train your intellect, he told him, ‚Äúfor the greatest thing in the smallest compass is a sound mind in a human body.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Among men who rise to fame and leadership two types are recognizable‚Äîthose who are born with a belief in themselves and those in whom it is a slow growth dependent on actual achievement. To the men of the last type their own success is a constant surprise, and its fruits the more delicious, yet to be tested cautiously with a haunting sense of doubt whether it is not all a dream. In that doubt lies true modesty, not the sham of insincere self-depreciation but the modesty of ‚Äúmoderation,‚Äù in the Greek sense. It is poise, not pose.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>One might say that the ability to evaluate one‚Äôs own ability is the most important skill of all. Without it, improvement is impossible. And certainly ego makes it difficult every step of the way. It is certainly more pleasurable to focus on our talents and strengths, but where does that get us? Arrogance and self-absorption inhibit growth. So does fantasy and ‚Äúvision.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is rare is not raw talent, skill, or even confidence, but humility, diligence, and self-awareness.</p>

  <p>‚ÄúNever give reasons for what you think or do until you must. Maybe, after a while, a better reason will pop into your head.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Research shows that while goal visualization is important, after a certain point our mind begins to confuse it with actual progress. The same goes for verbalization. Even talking aloud to ourselves while we work through difficult problems has been shown to significantly decrease insight and breakthroughs. After spending so much time thinking, explaining, and talking about a task, we start to feel that we‚Äôve gotten closer to achieving it. Or worse, when things get tough, we feel we can toss the whole project aside because we‚Äôve given it our best try, although of course we haven‚Äôt.</p>

  <p>Remember, ‚Äúzealot‚Äù is just a nice way to say ‚Äúcrazy person.‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wooden wasn‚Äôt about rah-rah speeches or inspiration. He saw those extra emotions as a burden. Instead, his philosophy was about being in control and doing your job and never being ‚Äúpassion‚Äôs slave.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Passion typically masks a weakness. Its breathlessness and impetuousness and franticness are poor substitutes for discipline, for mastery, for strength and purpose and perseverance. You need to be able to spot this in others and in yourself, because while the origins of passion may be earnest and good, its effects are comical and then monstrous.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can someone be busy and not accomplish anything? Well, that‚Äôs the passion paradox.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>What humans require in our ascent is purpose and realism. Purpose, you could say, is like passion with boundaries. Realism is detachment and perspective.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For us, it‚Äôs beginning to think that we‚Äôre better, that we‚Äôre special, that our problems and experiences are so incredibly different from everyone else‚Äôs that no one could possibly understand. It‚Äôs an attitude that has sunk far better people, teams, and causes than ours.</p>
