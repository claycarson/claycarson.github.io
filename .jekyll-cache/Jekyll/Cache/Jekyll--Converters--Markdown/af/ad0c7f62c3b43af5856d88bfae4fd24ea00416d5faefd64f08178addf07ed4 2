I"î<p>A great look at how a fantastic movie got made.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To ensure that the filmâ€™s twist was as surprising as possible, Bryan Singer persuaded several of the lead actors that their characters were really Keyzer SÃ¶ze. â€˜I remember when we screened it for the company of actors,â€™ recalled Kevin Spacey, â€˜Gabriel Byrne was stunned that he wasnâ€™t Keyser SÃ¶ze. Went out into the parking lot and had an argument with Bryan Singer. For a half an hour.â€™</p>
