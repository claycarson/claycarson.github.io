  <p>Think about your usual supermarket routine. Chances are, if your market is designed like the majority in the U.S., you start shopping at the right side of the store and work your way around the outer rim of the supermarketâ€”with occasional forays into certain aisles, but generally sticking to a counterclockwise route till you get to the register.</p>

  <p>Now you may wonder, Why do I always choose to go that way?</p>

  <p>The answer is, you donâ€™t. Whoever designed the supermarket chose that path for you, and for a particular reason: About nine in ten people are right-handed, and a counterclockwise route makes it easier for right-handed people to put stuff in their carts.</p>
