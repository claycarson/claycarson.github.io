<h3 id="2-the-domino-effect">2. The Domino Effect</h3>

  <p>Because extraordinary success is sequential, not simultaneous. What starts out linear becomes geometric. You do the right thing and then you do the next right thing. Over time it adds up, and the geometric potential of success is unleashed.</p>

<h3 id="3-success-leaves-clues">3. Success Leaves Clues</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Passion for something leads to disproportionate time practicing or working at it. That time spent eventually translates to skill, and when skill improves, results improve. Better results generally lead to more enjoyment, and more passion and more time is invested. It can be a virtuous cycle all the way to extraordinary results.</p>

<h3 id="4-everything-matters-equally">4. Everything Matters Equally</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>When everything feels urgent and important, everything seems equal. We become active and busy, but this doesnâ€™t actually move us any closer to success. Activity is often unrelated to productivity, and busyness rarely takes care of business.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Knocking out a hundred tasks for whatever the reason is a poor substitute for doing even one task thatâ€™s meaningful. Not everything matters equally, and success isnâ€™t a game won by whoever does the most. Yet that is exactly how most play it on a daily basis.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Selected effort creates almost all of the rewards.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether you say â€œlaterâ€ or â€œnever,â€ the point is to say â€œnot nowâ€ to anything else you could do until your most important work is done.</p>

<h3 id="5-multitasking">5. Multitasking</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Researchers estimate that workers are interrupted every 11 minutes and then spend almost a third of their day recovering from these distractions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>With an average of 4,000 thoughts a day flying in and out of our heads, itâ€™s easy to see why we try to multitask. If a change in thought every 14 seconds is an invitation to change direction, then itâ€™s rather obvious weâ€™re continually tempted to try to do too much at once. While doing one thing weâ€™re only seconds away from thinking of something else we could do.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chronic multitaskers develop a distorted sense of how long it takes to do things. They almost always believe tasks take longer to complete than is actually required.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Workers who use computers during the day change windows or check e-mail or other programs nearly 37 times an hour. Being in a distractible setting sets us up to be more distractible. Or maybe itâ€™s the high. Media multitaskers actually experience a thrill with switchingâ€”a burst of dopamineâ€”that can be addictive. Without it, they can feel bored. For whatever the reason, the results are unambiguous: multitasking slows us down and makes us slower witted.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He found that distracted driving is responsible for 16 percent of all traffic fatalities and nearly half a million injuries annually. Even an idle phone conversation when driving takes a 40 percent bite out of your focus and, surprisingly, can have the same effect as being drunk.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So when you see people who look like â€œdisciplinedâ€ people, what youâ€™re really seeing is people whoâ€™ve trained a handful of habits into their lives. This makes them seem â€œdisciplinedâ€ when actually theyâ€™re not. No one is.</p>

<h3 id="7-willpower-is-always-on-will-call">7. Willpower Is Always on Will-Call</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>When our willpower runs out, we all revert to our default settings. This begs the question: What are your default settings? If your willpower is dragging, will you grab the bag of carrots or the bag of chips? Will you be up for focusing on the work at hand or down for any distraction that drops in? When your most important work is done while your willpower wanes, default will define your level of achievement. Average is often the result.</p>

<h3 id="8-a-balanced-life">8. A Balanced Life</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The act of living a full life by giving time to what matters is a balancing act. Extraordinary results require focused attention and time. Time on one thing means time away from another. This makes balance impossible.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The idea of counterbalancing is that you never go so far that you canâ€™t find your way back or stay so long that there is nothing waiting for you when you return.</p>

<h3 id="10-the-focusing-question">10. The Focusing Question</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>And here is the prime condition of success, the great secretâ€”concentrate your energy, thought and capital exclusively upon the business in which you are engaged. Having begun on one line, resolve to fight it out on that line, to lead in it, adopt every improvement, have the best machinery, and know the most about it. The concerns which fail are those which have scattered their capital, which means that they have scattered their brains also. They have investments in this, or that, or the other, here, there and everywhere. â€œDonâ€™t put all your eggs in one basketâ€ is all wrong. I tell you â€œput all your eggs in one basket, and then watch that basket.â€ Look round you and take notice; men who do that do not often fail. It is easy to watch and carry the one basket. It is trying to carry too many baskets that breaks most eggs in this country.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The last two lines deserve repeating: â€œâ€¦ any wage I had asked of Life, Life would have willingly paid.â€ One of the most empowering moments of my life came when I realized that life is a question and how we live it is our answer.

  <p>â€œPeople do not decide their futures, they decide their habits and their habits decide their futures.â€ F. M. Alexander</p>

  <p>Low goals donâ€™t require extraordinary actions so they rarely lead to extraordinary results.</p>

  <p>A college professor once told me, â€œGary, youâ€™re smart, but people have lived before you. Youâ€™re not the first person to dream big, so youâ€™d be wise to study what others have learned first, and then build your actions on the back of their lessons.â€</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Highly productive people donâ€™t accept the limitations of their natural approach as the final word on their success. When they hit a ceiling of achievement, they look for new models and systems, better ways to do things to push them through. They pause just long enough to examine their options, they pick the best one, and then theyâ€™re right back at it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Accountable people are results oriented and never defend actions, skill levels, models, systems, or relationships that just arenâ€™t getting the job done. They bring their best to whatever it takes, without reservation.</p>

It carries anxiety, concern, uncertainty, hesitancy, indecision and inaction. The other is Faith. It brings calm, conviction, confidence, enthusiasm, decisiveness, excitement and action.â€ The grandson thought about it for a moment and then meekly asked his grandfather: â€œWhich wolf wins?â€ The old Cherokee replied, â€œThe one you feed.â€</p>
