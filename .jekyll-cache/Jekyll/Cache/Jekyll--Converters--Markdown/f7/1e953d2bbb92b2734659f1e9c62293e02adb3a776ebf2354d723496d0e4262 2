  <p>The BYU team also learned that a â€œlow angle of attackâ€ produces the least splash. When pee hits the porcelain at a 90 degree angle, the splashback is terrible. But when the urine simulator aimed lowâ€”imagine hitting just above the drain of the urinalâ€”the splash was more modest and not angled back at the urinator. This is also a good reason to aim sideways rather than straight at the urinal.</p>
