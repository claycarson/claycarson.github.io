<blockquote>
  <p>Maman died today. Or yesterday maybe, I don’t know.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>That’s when everything began to reel. The sea carried up a thick, fiery breath. It seemed to me as if the sky split open from one end to the other to rain down fire. My whole being tensed and I squeezed my hand around the revolver. The trigger gave; I felt the smooth underside of the butt; and there, in that noise, sharp and deafening at the same time, is where it all started. I shook off the sweat and sun. I knew that I had shattered the harmony of the day, the exceptional silence of a beach where I’d been happy. Then I fired four more times at the motionless body where the bullets lodged without leaving a trace. And it was like knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-1-1">Chapter 1</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>On my way out I was even going to shake his hand, but just in time, I remembered that I had killed a man.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>I realized then that a man who had lived only one day could easily live for a hundred years in prison. He would have enough memories to keep him from being bored. In a way, it was an advantage.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I hadn’t understood how days could be both long and short at the same time: long to live through, maybe, but so drawn out that they ended up flowing into one another. They lost their names. Only the words “yesterday” and “tomorrow” still had any meaning for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Deep down I knew perfectly well that it doesn’t much matter whether you die at thirty or at seventy, since in either case other men and women will naturally go on living—and for thousands of years.</p>
