  <p>Welcome to 8 Weeks to SEALFIT! You‚Äôve chosen to show your instructor (me) that you have the stuff to be SEALFIT. Now suit up and get the baseline screening test done! That‚Äôs right. You‚Äôre doing what you just read. If you can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt do this, don‚Äôt bother with the rest of the book. Put it down and walk away. I don‚Äôt work with people who aren‚Äôt ready to commit. When you‚Äôre ready to continue, complete:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>as many perfect, Navy SEAL‚Äìstyle push-ups as you can in 2 minutes</li>
    <li>10-minute rest</li>
    <li>as many sit-ups as you can in 2 minutes</li>
    <li>10-minute rest</li>
    <li>as many pull-ups as you can before you gas out</li>
    <li>10-minute rest</li>
    <li>a 500-meter swim (or substitute a 2,000-meter row if you don‚Äôt have access to a pool)</li>
    <li>10-minute rest</li>
    <li>a 1.5-mile run</li>
  </ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúLet the hammer hit your funny bone.‚Äù Rather than curl up and hunker down to ride out the storm, make light of the situation and find the lesson lurking inside.</p>

  <p>Today‚Äôs first assignment: Grab your journal, sit quietly, and reflect upon which four dominant emotions drive your behavior. Do you operate out of fear? Anger? Jealousy? Love? Joy? Courage? Be brutally honest with yourself. No one‚Äôs watching. Write your four down. It‚Äôs very important.</p>

  <p>Got your four down? Good. Now, answer the following questions: 1. What do these emotions keep me from creating in my life? 2. What beliefs create these four emotions? 3. What would I be like, and what would my life be like, if I could control these emotions?</p>

  <ol>
    <li>What benefit would it bring me and others if I acted with these ideal emotions?</li>
    <li>What beliefs do I need to change, and what new beliefs do I need to develop, to own these ideal emotions?</li>
    <li>What would I be like and what would my life be like, if I replaced my original four dominant emotions with these four ideal emotions?</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Reflect on your answers daily for the next 3 weeks. After 21 days your new beliefs and emotions will begin to form habits, which will define your new character.</p>

  <p>Your goal is not to just stay in the fight, but to crush it every time!</p>
