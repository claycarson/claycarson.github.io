<blockquote>
  <p>People who are searching for good enough are not second-guessing themselves. When thereâ€™s any little imperfection, people who are searching for the best donâ€™t say, â€œWell, the world has disappointed me.â€ They say, â€œI must have made a mistake.â€</p>

<p>I preferred the audio version to the written article, for what itâ€™s worth.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When Charles Barkleyâ€™s mother, Charcey Glenn, passed away in June 2015, Barkleyâ€™s hometown of Leeds, Alabama, came to the funeral to pay respects. But there was also an unexpected guest.</p>

  <p>Barkleyâ€™s friends couldnâ€™t quite place him. He wasnâ€™t a basketball player, he wasnâ€™t a sports figure, and he wasnâ€™t from Barkleyâ€™s hometown. Hereâ€™s what I can tell you about him: He wore striped, red polo shirts tucked into khaki shorts and got really excited about two-for-one deals. He was a commuter. He worked as a cat litter scientist in Muscatine, Iowa. In short, he was everyoneâ€™s suburban dad. More specifically, he was my dad.</p>

  <p>â€œYou know, it was obviously a very difficult time,â€ Barkley told me recently. â€œAnd the next thing I know, he shows up. Everybodyâ€™s like, â€˜Whoâ€™s the Asian dude over there?â€™ I just started laughing. I said, â€˜Thatâ€™s my boy, Lin.â€™ Theyâ€™re, like, â€˜How do you know him?â€™ I said, â€˜Itâ€™s a long story.â€™ â€œ</p>
