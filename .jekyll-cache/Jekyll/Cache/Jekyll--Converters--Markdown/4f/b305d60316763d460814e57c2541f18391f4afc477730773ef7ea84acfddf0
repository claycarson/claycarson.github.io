<blockquote>
  <p>Short story: when it comes to a flashed shot, there are three rules to remember: Shutter speed controls the amount of ambient light. Aperture (for the most part) controls the amount of flashed light, and… ISO works across both ambient and flashed light.</p>

<h2 id="lighting">Lighting</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Lights serve two primary purposes for flash-ambient blending: Eliminate enough ambient so that true colors can be revealed and Reduce ambient artifacts like glare on hardwood.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flashed frames are not the final product, and only serve to illuminate the room enough to get correct colors and avoid harsh glare.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="flash-power">Flash Power</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>So long story short: the primary goal of flash is to reduce the problems with ambient light.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When using ISO 320, I find that a good starting point for shutter speed is 1/ 10 second for an ambient shot, then, as mentioned earlier, about two stops higher for a flash shot.</p>
