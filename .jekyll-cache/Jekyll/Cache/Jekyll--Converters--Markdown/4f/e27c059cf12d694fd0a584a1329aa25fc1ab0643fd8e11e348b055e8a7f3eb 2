  <p>This is our push-up routine: Do one push-up then stand up and wait fifteen seconds, then go down and do two push-ups and wait fifteen seconds and so on, until we get up to ten push-ups, and then we start taking thirty-second breaks. For push-ups sixteen, seventeen, and eighteen, SEAL allows us to take forty-five seconds between sets.</p>

  <p>â€œSay, SEAL,â€ I say. â€œWhat would you do if there was an intruder in the house?â€ Slowly SEAL turns and looks at me. He holds me with an even, unemotional stare. Then he turns back to the TV without answering my question. â€œNo, really,â€ I say. â€œWhat would you do?â€ He shakes his head slowly. â€œI think you know what Iâ€™d do,â€ he says to the TV. â€œTell me.â€ â€œI would protect the primary.â€ â€œWhatâ€™s the primary?â€ â€œThatâ€™s the million-dollar question,â€ he says. â€œWhat is your primary, Jesse? What would hurt you the most to lose? This big-screen TV? Those gold record awards you own? Jewelry? Cash? What do you hold most dear?â€ â€œNo,â€ I say. â€œNone of that.â€ â€œWell?â€ he asks. â€œMy wife and my son.â€ â€œExactly, Jesse,â€ he says. â€œTheyâ€™re your primary, and as long as Iâ€™m in this house theyâ€™re my primary too. You asked me what I would do. I would protect my primary at any cost. And unfortunately for you, youâ€™re my third option.â€</p>
