  <p>Compare these scores to the bare minimum scores an officer hopeful must surpass in order to be considered competitive:</p>

  <p>500yd Swim - 9:00</p>

  <p>Pushups - 100</p>

  <p>Sit-ups - 100</p>

  <p>Pull-ups - 20</p>

  <p>1.5mi Run - 9:00</p>

  <p>An officer applicant who submits these scores would be at the bottom of the stack and would need to distinguish himself further to be seriously considered. A more likely selectee would furnish scores like these:</p>

  <p>500yd Swim - 7:00</p>

  <p>Pushups - 120</p>

  <p>Sit-ups - 120</p>

  <p>Pull-ups - 30</p>

  <p>1.5mi Run - 8:00</p>

  <p>Let me be clear: If you can pass the SEAL Challenge, you are fit enough to complete BUD/S.</p>
