I"Þ<p>Season 1 has come to an end. If you have missed the whirlwind surrounding Serial, I highly suggest using the holiday travel season to binge listen.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On January 13, 1999, a girl named Hae Min Lee, a senior at Woodlawn High School in Baltimore County, Maryland, disappeared.Â A month later, her body turned up in a city park. Sheâ€™d been strangled. Her 17-year-old ex-boyfriend, Adnan Syed, was arrested for the crime, and within a year, he was convicted and sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison. The case against him was largely based on the story of one witness, Adnanâ€™s friend Jay, who testified that he helped Adnan bury Haeâ€™s body. But Adnan has always maintained he had nothing to do with Haeâ€™s death. Some people believe heâ€™s telling the truth. Many others donâ€™t.</p>
