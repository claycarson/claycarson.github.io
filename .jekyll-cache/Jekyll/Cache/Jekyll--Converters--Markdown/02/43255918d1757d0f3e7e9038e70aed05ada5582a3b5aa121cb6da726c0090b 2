I"B<p>Barrack Obama’s ‘O’ logo could be found everywhere throughout the election season. it is a design that I myself absolutely loved and had many times wondered, how it came to be. In my Communication Graphics class, we look at logos, typography, etc. So my eyes had been expanding to take notice of designing well-thought-out logos.</p>

<p>The New York Times, has an interesting <a href="http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/the-o-in-obama">interview</a> with Sol Sender, a graphic designer that worked on the logo.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“At the end of 2006, Mode, a motion design studio in Chicago, approached Sol Sender, a graphic designer, to create a logo for Barack Obama’s presidential campaign. The resulting “O” became one of the most recognizable political logos in recent history. I spoke with Mr. Sender a few days after the election to discuss the evolution of his design.”</p>
