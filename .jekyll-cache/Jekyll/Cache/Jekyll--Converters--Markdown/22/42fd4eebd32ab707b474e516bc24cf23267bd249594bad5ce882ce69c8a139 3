  <p>Auschwitz I and nearby Auschwitz II-Birkenau were the extermination camps where an estimated 1.1 million peopleâ€”mostly Jews from across Europe, but also political opponents, prisoners of war, homosexuals, and Romaâ€”were killed in gas chambers or by systematic starvation, forced labor, disease, or medical experiments. About 200,000 camp inmates survived the ordeal.</p>
