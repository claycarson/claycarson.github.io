  <p>In this book, youâ€™ll naturally look for common habits and recommendations, and you should. Here are a few patterns, some odder than others: More than 80% of the interviewees have some form of daily mindfulness or meditation practice A surprising number of males (not females) over 45 never eat breakfast, or eat only the scantiest of fare (e.g., Laird Hamilton, page 92; Malcolm Gladwell, page 572; General Stanley McChrystal, page 435) Many use the ChiliPad device for cooling at bedtime Rave reviews of the books Sapiens, Poor Charlieâ€™s Almanack, Influence, and Manâ€™s Search for Meaning, among others The habit of listening to single songs on repeat for focus (page 507) Nearly everyone has done some form of â€œspecâ€ work (completing projects on their own time and dime, then submitting them to prospective buyers) The belief that â€œfailure is not durableâ€ (see Robert Rodriguez, page 628) or variants thereof Almost every guest has been able to take obvious â€œweaknessesâ€ and turn them into huge competitive advantages (see Arnold Schwarzenegger, page 176)</p>

  <p><strong>Rule #1:Â </strong>Avoid â€œwhiteâ€ starchy carbohydrates (or those that can be white). This means all bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, and grains (yes, including quinoa). If you have to ask, donâ€™t eat it.</p>

  <p><strong>Rule #2:</strong> Eat the same few meals over and over again, especially for breakfast and lunch. Good news: You already do this. Youâ€™re just picking new default meals. If you want to keep it simple, split your plate into thirds: protein, veggies, and beans/ legumes.</p>

  <p><strong>Rule #3:</strong> Donâ€™t drink calories. Exception: 1 to 2 glasses of dry red wine per night is allowed, although this can cause some peri-/ post-menopausal women to plateau.</p>

  <p><strong>Rule #4:</strong> Donâ€™t eat fruit. (Fructose â†’ glycerol phosphate â†’ more body fat, more or less.) Avocado and tomatoes are allowed.</p>

  <p><strong>Rule #5:</strong> Whenever possible, measure your progress in body fat percentage, NOT total pounds. The scale can deceive and derail you. For instance, itâ€™s common to gain muscle while simultaneously losing fat on the SCD. Thatâ€™s exactly what you want, but the scale number wonâ€™t move, and you will get frustrated. In place of the scale, I use DEXA scans, a BodyMetrix home ultrasound device, or calipers with a gym professional (I recommend the Jackson-Pollock 7-point method). And then:</p>

  <p><strong>Rule #6:</strong> Take one day off per week and go nuts. I choose and recommend Saturday. This is â€œcheat day,â€ which a lot of readers also call â€œFaturday.â€ For biochemical and psychological reasons, itâ€™s important not to hold back. Some readers keep a â€œto-eatâ€ list during the week, which reminds them that theyâ€™re only giving up vices for 6 days at a time. Comprehensive step-by-step details, including Q&amp; As and troubleshooting, can be found in The 4-Hour Body, but the preceding outline is often enough to lose 20 pounds in a month, and drop 2 clothing sizes.</p>

  <p>Among effective midsection exercises are â€˜power breathing,â€™ hollow rocks, Janda sit-ups, hanging leg raises, and â€˜hard-style planks.â€™ To do the last, hold a plank for 10 seconds under max contraction, not for several minutes. Hold it like youâ€™re about to be kicked and breathe â€˜behind the shieldâ€™ of your tensed midsection. For a challenge, consider putting your feet on the wall, a few inches from the floor.â€</p>

  <p>â€œGrease the Grooveâ€ for Strength Endurance and Strength â€œTo increase your pull-up numbers, start doing half the reps youâ€™re capable of (e.g., sets of 4 if your personal best is 8) in repeated sets throughout the day. Simply accumulate reps with at least 15 minutes between sets, and adjust the daily volume to always feel fresh.â€ Using GTG for several months, Pavelâ€™s father-in-law went from 10 to 20 strict pull-ups at age 64â€”and he could not do that many when he was a young Marine. The minimum of 15 minutesâ€™ rest is necessary for creatine phosphate hypercompensation. â€œWhereas most strength-endurance programs work by training one to tolerate more lactic acid, GTG instead trains one to produce less acid. It increases the quantity and quality of mitochondria in fast-twitch muscle fibers and makes them more aerobic.â€ If you are â€œgreasing the grooveâ€ for a maximal strength movement, do not exceed 5 reps per set. In this case, the method works through a different mechanism (for the nerds: synaptic facilitation and myelination). Letâ€™s say youâ€™re working up to a single perfect rep of a one-armed push-up. In your progression, you might do one-armed push-ups with feet on the floor and hands on the edge of a table or counter. If 6 reps is your max, you would do GTG sets of no more than 2 to 3 reps.</p>

I make sure that one of them is very, very simple: the wind on my face, the reflection of the clouds that I just saw. But I donâ€™t just think gratitude. I let gratitude fill my soul, because when youâ€™re grateful, we all know thereâ€™s no anger. Itâ€™s impossible to be angry and grateful simultaneously. When youâ€™re grateful, there is no fear. You canâ€™t be fearful and grateful simultaneously.â€ The second 3 minutes: â€œTotal focus on feeling the presence of God, if you will, however you want to language that for yourself. But this inner presence coming in, and feeling it heal everything in my body, in my mind, my emotions, my relationships, my finances. I see it as solving anything that needs to be solved. I experience the strengthening of my gratitude, of my conviction, of my passion. . . .â€ The last 3 minutes: â€œFocusing on three things that Iâ€™m going to make happen, my â€˜three to thrive.â€™â€¦See it as though itâ€™s already been done, feel the emotions, etcâ€¦.</p>

  <p>â€œYou canâ€™t blame your boss for not giving you the support you need. Plenty of people will say, â€˜Itâ€™s my bossâ€™s fault.â€™ No, itâ€™s actually your fault because you havenâ€™t educated him, you havenâ€™t influenced him, you havenâ€™t explained to him in a manner he understands why you need this support that you need. Thatâ€™s extreme ownership. Own it all.â€</p>

<h2 id="the-dickens-processwhat-are-your-beliefs-costing-you">The Dickens Processâ€”What Are Your Beliefs Costing You?</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>In A Christmas Carol, Scrooge is visited by the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future. In the Dickens Process, youâ€™re forced to examine limiting beliefsâ€”say, your top two or three handicapping beliefsâ€”across each tense. Tony guides you through each in depth, and I recall answering and visualizing variations of: What has each belief cost you in the past, and what has it cost people youâ€™ve loved in the past? What have you lost because of this belief? See it, hear it, feel it. What is each costing you and people you care about in the present? See it, hear it, feel it. What will each cost you and people you care about 1, 3, 5, and 10 years from now? See it, hear it, feel it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do. As I have heard said, a personâ€™s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have. Resolve to do one thing every day that you fear. I got into this habit by attempting to contact celebrities and famous businesspeople for advice.</p>

  <p>Write to Get Ideas, Not to Express Them â€œWhat I discovered, which is what many writers discover, is that I write in order to think. Iâ€™d say, â€˜I think I have an idea,â€™ but when I begin to write it, I realize, â€˜I have no idea,â€™ and I donâ€™t actually know what I think until I try and write itâ€¦.That was the revelation.â€</p>

  <p>I recently learned a neologism that, like political correctness, man cave, and content-provider, I instantly recognized as heralding an ugly new turn in the culture: planshopping. That is, deferring committing to any one plan for an evening until you know what all your options are, and then picking the one thatâ€™s most likely to be fun/ advance your career/ have the most girls at itâ€”in other words, treating people like menu options or products in a catalog.</p>

  <p>Whereas most competitors are secretive about their competition prep, Marcelo routinely records and uploads his sparring sessions, his exact training for major events. Josh explains the rationale: â€œMarcelo was visually showing these competitors what he was about to use against them at 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks (away from competition), and his attitude about this was just completely unique: â€˜If youâ€™re studying my game, youâ€™re entering my game, and Iâ€™ll be better at it than you.â€™â€</p>
