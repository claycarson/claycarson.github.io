<p class="handwriting">And, to be honest, I don't have a specific agenda for what I want to do all that differently, apart from what I'm already trying to do every day: Identify and destroy small-return bullshit; shut off anything that's noisier than it is useful; make brutally fast decisions about what I don't need to be doing; avoid anything that feels like fake sincerity (especially where it may touch money); demand personal focus on making good things; put a handful of real people near the center of everything. All I know right now is that I want to do all of it better. Everything better.</p>
