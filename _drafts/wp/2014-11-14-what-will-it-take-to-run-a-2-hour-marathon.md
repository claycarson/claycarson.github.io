<h2>The Perfect Race</h2>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>It will be a cold day in March (or November).</li>
  <li>The course will be mind-numbingly boring (and perhaps in Poland).</li>
  <li>The pacemakes will form a human wall, setting the state for a time trial.</li>
  <li>The payday will be mind-blowing, but not tethered to a specific race.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<h2>The Perfect Runner</h2>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>He'll have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Radcliffe">Paula Radcliffe's</a> efficiency (and vertical leap).</li>
  <li>He'll be 5'6" and a buck-twenty soaking wet.</li>
  <li>He'll have towering self-confidence and very fast friends.</li>
  <li>He'll have access to things we can't imagine.</li>
  <li>He'll be in his early twenties - and fearless.</li>
  </ol>
