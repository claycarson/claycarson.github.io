Just in time for your July 4th game of wiffle ball.

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>It's not a real Wiffle ball game unless you can break a window. Or windows.</li>
  <li>Skinny yellow bats only...</li>
  <li>Yes you can throw your super-awesome curve ball. But throw it fat and slow over the plate. Like a 2011 Astro.</li>
  </ul>
