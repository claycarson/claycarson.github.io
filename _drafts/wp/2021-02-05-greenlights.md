<blockquote>“I believe the truth is only offensive when we are lying.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Knowing the truth, seeing the truth, and telling the truth are all different experiences”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“One in a row. Any success takes one in a row. Do one thing well then another. Once then once more, over and over until the end.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The older you do the the more rules they are going to try to get you to follow you just gotta keep livin’ man. L-I-V-I-N.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Just keep livin’. Lowercase because life is nobody’s proper now and ain’t no G on the end because life is a verb.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“While we are here we believe more than we know.”
</blockquote>
