Sometimes you experience a creator for the first time and you crave a firehose of their work be blasted into your face. I felt this way not only about Wright Thompson's writing but his whole vibe. I first heard him on the <a href="https://nolayingup.com/podcasts/no-laying-up-podcast/nlu-podcast-episode-372-wright-thompson-on-the-masters">No Laying Up</a> podcast. Although, I had his book, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/544605/pappyland-by-wright-thompson/">"Pappyland: A Story of Family, Fine Bourbon, and the Things that Last"</a> on my reading list and was working my way through it as I listened to the episode.

I came across <a href="https://dailystoic.com/wright-thompson/">this episode of The Daily Stoic</a> featuring a conversation between he and <a href="http://ryanholiday.net">Ryan Holiday</a>. I can only recall <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/o2h8bx">one other time</a> that I immediately restarted a podcast episode after finishing. The second time required pen and paper. Here are my notes:

<li>“I almost feel like the ultimate ambition is to be really great at what you do and not be turned into a monster in the process.” - Ryan Holiday</li>
<li>“The whole point of success is that it is an asset to trade for something. - Wright Thompson</li>
<li>“There are very few chances in life where you are faced with a decision to prove whether you are the thing you say you are or if you are full of shit.” - Wright Thompson</li>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  Tonight I'll be on that hill 'cause I can't stop
  I'll be on that hill with everything I got
  Lives on the line where dreams are found and lost
  I'll be there on time and I'll pay the cost
  For wanting things that can only be found
  In the darkness on the edge of town
</blockquote>

<li>“We are ghosts or we are ancestors in our children’s lives. We either lay our mistakes and our burdens upon them, and we haunt them as ghosts. Or, we assist them in laying those old burdens down, and we free them from the chains of our own flawed behavior, and as ancestors, we walk alongside of them, assisting them to find their own way, and some sense of transcendence.” - <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80232329">Springsteen on Broadway</a></li>
