This newsletter is a collection of things I have found in the last month that I enjoyed, found interesting, or simply wanted to share.

300 million years ago the current location of my home emerged from the sea. Some of my neighbors may have also arrived at that time.

Gary Hustwit has a <a href="https://www.hustwit.com/rams/" title="Documentary">documentary</a> about designer Dieter Rams coming out soon.

From objects to influence, Rams’ contribution to our everyday lives is expansive.

<blockquote>
  “Dieter Rams’ ability to bring form to a product so that it clearly, concisely and immediately communicates its meaning is remarkable… He remains utterly alone in producing a body of work so consistently beautiful, so right, and so accessible.” – Jonathan Ive, Apple’s Chief Design Officer

<blockquote>
  A part of me loves you,
  A part of me hates you,
  A part of me needs you,
  A part of me fears you.
</blockquote>

In this podcast, Jesse David Fox and Bo Burnham discuss the finale to Bo’s special, ‘<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80106124" title="Make Happy">Make Happy</a>’. In an auto-tuned Kanye-esque rant we hear about Pringles, Chipotle, and Bo’s view of the audience and performing.

Bo has directed a movie called <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7014006/" title="Eighth Grade">Eighth Grade</a> receiving tremendous acclaim. The production company for the film, <a href="https://a24films.com" title="A24">A24</a>, has had recent success with Ladybird, Moonlight, The Disaster Artist, The Killing of a Sacred Deer, Ex Machina, and The Lobster.

Bill Gates has his <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Summer-Books-2018" title="5 books worth reading this summer">5 books worth reading this summer</a>.

<blockquote>
  I’ve read some terrific books lately. When I pulled together this list of five that you might enjoy this summer, I realized that several of my choices wrestle with big questions. What makes a genius tick? Why do bad things happen to good people? Where does humanity come from, and where are we headed?
