<blockquote>
  To ensure that the film’s twist was as surprising as possible, Bryan Singer persuaded several of the lead actors that their characters were really Keyzer Söze. ‘I remember when we screened it for the company of actors,’ recalled Kevin Spacey, ‘Gabriel Byrne was stunned that he wasn’t Keyser Söze. Went out into the parking lot and had an argument with Bryan Singer. For a half an hour.’

A great look at how a fantastic movie got made.
