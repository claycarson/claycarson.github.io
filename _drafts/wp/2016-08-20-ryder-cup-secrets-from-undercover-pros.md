  This isn't just jingoistic chirping about the enemy. In some cases, it's Americans critiquing Americans, or Europeans burying Europeans: "It started with slightly dodgy mechanics," said one, "and it has developed into a full-blown mental problem." Another player's weakness is highlighted: "Over a bunker to a tight flag is his worst nightmare. It's not pretty." And this: "He's well capable of giving up. ... If he's not in the mood, he's just not in the mood."
