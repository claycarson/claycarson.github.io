<blockquote>
  The Italian automaker founded in 1963 by feisty Ferrari hater Ferruccio Lamborghini built a long line of swoopy exotics that demanded passionate, dedicated drivers — with an equally passionate and dedicated mechanic on speed dial. Several ownership changes over the years, including an ill-fated union with Chrysler in the 1980s didn't help the cause. Lamborghinis inspired lust, but consistency of build and reliability proved elusive.
  
  Until the Germans got involved.
