## Black Lives Matter

[You Want a Confederate Monument? My Body Is a Confederate Monument](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/opinion/confederate-monuments-racism.html "You Want a Confederate Monument? My Body Is a Confederate Monument")

> I have rape-colored skin. My light-brown-blackness is a living testament to the rules, the practices, the causes of the Old South.
> 
> If there are those who want to remember the legacy of the Confederacy, if they want monuments, well, then, **my body is a monument**. My skin is a monument.

[Don’t understand the protests? What you’re seeing is people pushed to the edge](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-05-30/dont-understand-the-protests-what-youre-seeing-is-people-pushed-to-the-edge "Don’t understand the protests? What you’re seeing is people pushed to the edge")

> But African Americans have been living in a burning building for many years, choking on the smoke as the flames burn closer and closer. Racism in America is like dust in the air. It seems invisible — even if you’re choking on it — until you let the sun in. Then you see it’s everywhere. As long as we keep shining that light, we have a chance of cleaning it wherever it lands. But we have to stay vigilant, because it’s always still in the air.

> I use time as a medium to define how long each portrait is colored in. 1 year of life = 1 minute of color…So for each of these portraits I played with the harsh relationship between time and death. I want the viewer to see how much empty space is left in these lives, stories that will never be told, space that can never be filled. This emptiness represents holes in their families and our community, who will be forever stuck with the question, “who were they becoming?”

> We’re not desperate for heroes in the black community. Anyone who survives this nightmare is my god-damned hero.
