## Egg-cellent

[Always on the Side of the Egg](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/1.5076881)

> Between a high, solid wall and an egg that breaks against it, I will always stand on the side of the egg.”
> 
> Yes, no matter how right the wall may be and how wrong the egg, I will stand with the egg. Someone else will have to decide what is right and what is wrong; perhaps time or history will decide. If there were a novelist who, for whatever reason, wrote works standing with the wall, of what value would such works be?
> 
> What is the meaning of this metaphor? In some cases, it is all too simple and clear. Bombers and tanks and rockets and white phosphorus shells are that high, solid wall. The eggs are the unarmed civilians who are crushed and burned and shot by them. This is one meaning of the metaphor.
> 
> This is not all, though. It carries a deeper meaning. Think of it this way. Each of us is, more or less, an egg. Each of us is a unique, irreplaceable soul enclosed in a fragile shell. This is true of me, and it is true of each of you. And each of us, to a greater or lesser degree, is confronting a high, solid wall. The wall has a name: It is The System. The System is supposed to protect us, but sometimes it takes on a life of its own, and then it begins to kill us and cause us to kill others — coldly, efficiently, systematically.

> “So what’s the point of it all?”
> “Seriously?” I asked. “Seriously? You’re asking me for the meaning of life? Isn’t that a little stereotypical?”
> “Well it’s a reasonable question,” you persisted.
> I looked you in the eye. “The meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.”
> “You mean mankind? You want us to mature?”
> “No, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.”
> “Just me? What about everyone else?”
> “There is no one else,” I said. “In this universe, there’s just you and me.”
> You stared blankly at me. “But all the people on earth…”
> “All you. Different incarnations of you.”
> “Wait. I’m everyone!?”
> “Now you’re getting it,”
> …
> “Once you’ve lived every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be born.”

[The Case of the Top Secret iPod](https://tidbits.com/2020/08/17/the-case-of-the-top-secret-ipod/ "The Case of the Top Secret iPod")

> It was a gray day in late 2005. I was sitting at my desk, writing code for the next year’s iPod. Without knocking, the director of iPod Software—my boss’s boss—abruptly entered and closed the door behind him. He cut to the chase. “I have a special assignment for you. Your boss doesn’t know about it. You’ll help two engineers from the US Department of Energy build a special iPod. Report only to me.”
