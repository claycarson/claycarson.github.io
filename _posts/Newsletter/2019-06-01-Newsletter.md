## Bob, Why a PDF?

> Everyone knew that the US Department of Justice and Attorney General Barr would release the Mueller Report as a PDF file.

[The Complicated Kevin Na: A Case Study in the Frailty of a Golfer’s Psyche](https://www.golf.com/tour-and-news/complicated-kevin-na-case-study-frailty-golfers-psyche "The Complicated Kevin Na: A Case Study in the Frailty of a Golfer’s Psyche")

> On every swing a battle raged between his technical proficiency and mental fragility. He would stand over the ball, his mind jumbled with swing thoughts. His hands strangled the grip, his arms were knots of tension. The seconds would tick by, and he felt powerless to lift the club. Then the uncertainty would ebb just long enough to allow him to start his swing, and the resulting shot would be flawless.

Seriously painful to watch: “[Pull the trigger!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRKH4nIWRUg "Pull the Trigger!")”
