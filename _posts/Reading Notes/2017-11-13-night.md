> In the beginning there was faith—which is. Childish; trust—which is vain; and illusion—which is dangerous.
> 

> To forget would be not only dangerous but offensive; to forget the dead would be akin to killing them a second time. 
> 

> I was nothing but a body...The stomach alone was measuring time.
> 

> Behind me, I heard the same man asking:
> “For God’s sake, where is God?”
> And from within me, I heard a voice answer:
> “Where He is? This is where—hanging here from this gallows...”
> 

> One died because one had to. No point in making trouble.
