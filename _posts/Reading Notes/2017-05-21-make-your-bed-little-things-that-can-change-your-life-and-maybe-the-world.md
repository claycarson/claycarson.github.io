## CHAPTER ONE: Start Your Day with a Task Completed 
> Making my bed correctly was not going to be an opportunity for praise. It was expected of me. It was my first task of the day, and doing it right was important. It demonstrated my discipline. It showed my attention to detail, and at the end of the day it would be a reminder that I had done something well, something to be proud of, no matter how small the task. 
 
## CHAPTER FIVE: Failure Can Make You Stronger 
> I sometimes fell short of being the best, but I never fell short of giving it my best. 
 
## CHAPTER EIGHT: Rise to the Occasion 
> “Tonight, you will have to be your very best. You must rise above your fears, your doubts, and your fatigue. No matter how dark it gets, you must complete the mission. This is what separates you from everyone else.”
