## Book Two: The Monster Attacks: What Blogs Mean 

### XVIII The Iterative Hustle: Online Journalism’s Bogus Philosophy
> The poet Hesiod once wrote that rumor and gossip are a “light weight to lift up, but heavy to carry and hard to put down.” 
 
### XIX The Myth of Corrections
> The human mind “first believes, then evaluates,” as one psychologist put it. To that I’d add, “as long as it doesn’t get distracted first.”
 
### XXI The Dark Side of Snark: When Internet Humor Attacks
> New Yorker critic David Denby came closest to properly defining snark in his book Snark: It’s Mean, It’s Personal, and It’s Ruining Our Conversation. He didn’t succeed entirely, but “snark attempts to steal someone’s mojo, erase her cool, annihilate her effectiveness with the nasty, insidious, rug-pulling, teasing insult, which makes reference to some generally understood shared prejudice or distaste” will do. 
 
### Conclusion: So…Where to From Here? 
> When intelligent people read, they ask themselves a simple question: What do I plan to do with this information?
