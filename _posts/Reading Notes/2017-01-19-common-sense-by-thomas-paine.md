## Chapter 2 OF MONARCHY AND HEREDITARY SUCCESSION
> Male and female are the distinctions of nature, good and bad the distinctions of heaven; but how a race of men came into the world so exalted above the rest, and distinguished like some new species, is worth inquiring into, and whether they are the means of happiness or of misery to mankind. 

## Chapter 1 OF THE ORIGIN AND DESIGN OF GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL, WITH CONCISE REMARKS ON THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION
> Society is produced by our wants, and government by our wickedness; the former promotes our happiness POSITIVELY by uniting our affections, the latter NEGATIVELY by restraining our vices. 
 
> …it is the pride of kings which throw mankind into confusion. 

## Chapter 3 THOUGHTS ON THE PRESENT STATE OF AMERICAN AFFAIRS
> …if they cannot conquer us, they cannot govern us. 
 
> Is the power who is jealous of our prosperity, a proper power to govern us? 

> For as in absolute governments the King is law, so in free countries the law OUGHT to be King; and there ought to be no other. But lest any ill use should afterwards arise, let the crown at the conclusion of the ceremony, be demolished, and scattered among the people whose right it is. 
 
> When we are planning for posterity, we ought to remember, that virtue is not hereditary. 

## Chapter 4 OF THE PRESENT ABILITY OF AMERICA, WITH SOME MISCELLANEOUS REFLECTIONS
> The more men have to lose, the less willing are they to venture. The rich are in general slaves to fear, and submit to courtly power with the trembling duplicity of a Spaniel.
