## Shutter Speed v. Aperture v. ISO 

> Short story: when it comes to a flashed shot, there are three rules to remember: Shutter speed controls the amount of ambient light. Aperture (for the most part) controls the amount of flashed light, and… ISO works across both ambient and flashed light. 

## Lighting 
>Lights serve two primary purposes for flash-ambient blending: Eliminate enough ambient so that true colors can be revealed and Reduce ambient artifacts like glare on hardwood. 

>Flashed frames are not the final product, and only serve to illuminate the room enough to get correct colors and avoid harsh glare.

## Flash Power
>So long story short: the primary goal of flash is to reduce the problems with ambient light. 

>When using ISO 320, I find that a good starting point for shutter speed is 1/ 10 second for an ambient shot, then, as mentioned earlier, about two stops higher for a flash shot. 

>There is much you can do with the copy settings dialog, but make sure “White Balance” is NOT selected.
