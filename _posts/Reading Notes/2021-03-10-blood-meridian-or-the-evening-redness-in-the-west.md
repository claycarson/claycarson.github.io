## Chapter 2
<!-- Page 16 -->
> He’s left behind the pinewood country and the evening sun declines before him beyond an endless swale and dark falls here like a thunderclap and a cold wind sets the weeds to gnashing. The night sky lies so sprint with stars that there is scarcely space of black at all and they fall all night in bitter arcs and it is so that their numbers are no less.

> The sun that rises is the color of steel. His mounted shadow falls for miles before him.

<!-- Page 20 -->
> A man’s at odds to know his mind cause his mind is aught he has to know it with. He can know his heart, but he don’t want to. Rightly so. Best not to look in there. It ain’t the heart of a creature that is bound in the way that God has set for it. You can find meanness in the least of creatures, but when God made man the devil was at his elbow. A creature that can do anything. Make a machine. And a machine to make the machine. And evil can run itself a thousand years, no need to tend it.

<!-- Page 23 -->
> The sun was just down and to the west lay reefs of bloodied clouds up out of which rose little desert nighthawks like fugitives from some great fire at the earth’s end.

<!-- Page 29 -->

> Then he waded out into the river like some wholly wretched baptismal candidate.

## Chapter 4
<!-- Page 52 -->

> They set forth in a crimson dawn where sky and earth closed in a razors plane. Out there dark little archipelagos of cloud and the vast world of sand and scrub shearing upward into the shoreless void where those blue islands trembled and the earth grew uncertain, gravely canted and veering out through tinctures of rose and the dark beyond the dawn to the uttermost rebate of space.

## Chapter 5
<!-- Page 69 -->

> I know your kind, he said. What’s wrong with you is wrong all the way through you.

## Chapter 7
<!-- Page 89 -->

> A dark vein in his temple pulsed like a fuse.

## Chapter 8
<!-- Page 110-111 -->

> The crumpled butcher paper mountains lay in sharp shadow fold under the long blue dusk and in the middle distance the glazed bed of a dry lake lay shimmering like the mare imbrue and herds of deer were moving north in the last of the twilight, harried over the plain by wolves who were themselves the color of the desert floor.

## Chapter 10
<!-- Page 130 -->

> At night, said Tobin, when the horses are grazing and the company is asleep, who hears them grazing?
> 
> Don’t nobody hear them if they’re asleep.
> 
> Aye. And if they cease their grazing who is it that wakes?
> 
> Every man.
> 
> Aye, said the expriest. Every man.

<!-- Page 132 -->

> It was a day’s work to even guess what he made of that figure on that ground.

## Chapter 11
<!-- Page 145 -->

> In the days to come they would ride up through a country where the rocks would cook the flesh from your hand and where other than rock nothing was. They rode in a narrow enfilade along a trail strewn with the dry round turns of goats and they rode with their faces averted from the rock wall and the bakeoven air which it rebated, the slant black shapes of the mounted men stenciled across the stone with a definition austere and implacable like shapes capable of violating their covenant with the flesh that authored them and continuing autonomous across the naked rock without reference to sun or man or god.

<!-- Page 154 -->

> A love shaped moon rose over the black shapes of the mountains dimming out the eastern stars and along the nearby ridge the white blooms of flowering yuccas moved in the wind and in the night bats came from some nether part of the world to stand on leather wings like dark satanic hummingbirds and feed at the mouths of those flowers.

## Chapter 16
<!-- Page 241 -->

>In truth they did not look like men who might have whiskey they hadn’t drunk.

<!-- Page 242 -->

> It was the first word any of them had spoken. Couts looked them over. Haggard and haunted and blacked by the sun. The lines and pores of their skin deeply grimed with gunlock where they’d washed the bores of their weapons. Even the horses looked alien to any he’d ever seen, decked as they were in human hair and teeth and skin. Save for their guns and buckles and a few pieces of metal in the harness of the animals there was nothing about these arrivals to suggest even the discovery of the wheel.

## Chapter 17
<!-- Page 256 -->

> The universe is no narrow thing and the order within it is not constrained by any latitude in its conception to repeat what exists in one part in any other part. Even in this world more things exist without our knowledge than with it and the order in creation which you see is that which you have put there, like a string in a maze, so that you shall not lose your way. For existence has its own order and that no man’s mind can compass, that mind itself being but a fact among others.

> Before man was, war waited for him.

<!-- Page 260-261 -->

> The judge smiled. Men are born for games. Nothing else. Every child knows that play is nobler than work. He knows too that the worth or merit of game is not inherent in the game itself but rather in the value of that which is put at hazard. Games of chance require a wager to have meaning at all. Games of sport involve the skill and strength of the opponents and the humiliation of defeat and the pride of victory are in themselves sufficient stake because they inhere in the worth of the principals and define them. But trial of chance or trial of worth all games aspire to the condition of war for here that which is wagered swallows up game, player, all. 
> 
> Suppose two men at cards with nothing to wager save their lives. Who has not heard such a tale? A turn of the card. The whole universe for such a player has labored clanking to this moment which will tell if he is to die at that man's hand or that man at his. What more certain validation of a man's worth could there be? This enhancement of the game to its ultimate state admits no argument concerning the notion of fate. The selection of one man over another is preference absolute and irrevocable and it is a dull man indeed who could reckon so profound a decision without agency or significance either one. In such games as have for their stake the annihilation of the defeated the decisions are quite clear. This man holding this particular arrangement of cards in his hand is thereby removed from existence. This is the nature of war, whose stake is at once the game and the authority and the justification. Seen so, war is the truest form of divination. It is the testing of one's will and the will of another within that larger will which because it binds them is therefore forced to select. War is the ultimate game because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence. War is god. 
> 
> Brown studied the judge. You're crazy Holden. Crazy at last.
> 
> The judge smiled. 
> 
> Might does not make right, said Irving. The man that wins in some combat is not vindicated morally. 
> 
> Moral law is an invention of mankind for the disenfranchisement of the powerful in favor of the weak. Historical law subverts it at every turn. A moral view can never be proven right or wrong by any ultimate test. A man falling dead in a duel is not thought thereby to be proven in error as to his views. His very involvement in such a trial gives evidence of a new and broader view. The willingness of the principals to forgo further argument as the triviality which it in fact is and to petition directly the chambers of the historical absolute clearly indicates of how little moment are the opinions and of what great moment the divergences thereof. For the argument is indeed trivial, but not so the separate wills thereby made manifest. Man's vanity may well approach the infinite in capacity but his knowledge remains imperfect and howevermuch he comes to value his judgements ultimately he must submit them before a higher court. Here there can be no special pleading. Here are considerations of equity and rectitude and moral right rendered void and without warrant and here are the views of the litigants despised. Decisions of life and death, of what shall be and what shall not, beggar all question of right. In elections of these magnitudes are all lesser ones subsumed, moral, spiritual, natural.

> The ragged sparks blew down the wind. The prairie about them lay silent. Beyond the fire it was cold and the night was clear and the stars were falling. The old hunter pulled his blanket about him. I wonder if there’s other worlds like this, he said. Or if this is the only one.

<!-- Page 334 -->

> How old are you?
> 
> He’s fifteen.
> 
> You hush your damn mouth.
> 
> He turned to the man. He don’t speak for me, he said.
> 
> He’s done spoke. I was fifteen year old when I was first shot.
> 
> I ain’t never been shot.
> 
> You ain’t sixteen yet neither.

<!-- Page 344 -->

> Men’s memories are uncertain and the past that was differs little from the past that was not.
