## Publisher's Note

> The teaching of Epictetus suggests that man should be grateful to God for all things, and should be content with whatever occurs, for whatever happens is God's will, and the deity's choice is bound to be superior to human wishes. "God" in this case is not the divine being of Judaeo-Christian theology, but a material immanence conceived of as a fiery breath infused in all things. This force of nature creates and directs the world as we experience it and it is therefore up to the individual to live accruing to nature, since theis divine intelligence has made the best of all possible worlds.

## The Encheiridion, or Manual

### 9 

> Disease is an impediment to the body, but not to the will, unless the will itself chooses. Lameness is an impediment to the leg, but not to the will. And add this reflection on the occasion of everything that is happens; for you will find it an impediment to something else, but not to yourself.

### 10

> On the occasion of every accident (event) that befalls you, remember to turn to yourself and inquire what power you have for turning it to use.

### 11

> But what is it to you, by whose hands the giver demanded it back? So long as he may allow you, take care of it as a thing which belongs to another, as travelers do with their inn.

### 14

> If you would have your children and your wife and your friends to live forever, you are silly; for you would have the things which are not in your power to be in your power, and the things which belong to others to be yours.

### 23

> If it should ever happen to you to be turned to externals in order to please some person, you must know that you have lost your purpose in life.

### 33

> In company take care not to speak much and excessively about your own acts or dangers: for as it is pleasant to you to make mention of your dangers, it is not so pleasant to others to hear what has happened to you Take care also not to provoke laughter; for this is a slippery way toward vulgar habits, and is also adapted to diminish the respect of your neighbors. It is a dangerous habit also to approach obscene talk. When then anything of this kind happens, if there is a good opportunity, rebuke the man who has proceeded to this talk: but if there is not an opportunity, by your silence at least, and blushing and expression of dissatisfaction by your countenance, show plainly that you are displease at such talk.

### 46

> Accordingly if any conversation should arise among uninstructed persons about any theorem, generally be silet; for there is great danger that you will immediately vomit up what you have not digested. And when a man shall say to you, that you know nothing, and you are not vexed, then be sure that you have begun to work (of philosophy). For even sheep do not vomit up their grass and show to the shepherds how much they have eaten; but when they have internally digested the pasture, they produce externally wool and milk.

## Fragments

### 4

> It is better to do wrong seldom and to own it, and to act right for the most part, than seldom to admit that you have done wrong and to do wrong often

### 11

> If you wish to live without perturbation and with pleasure, try to have all who dwell with you good.

### 13

> No man who loves money, and loves pleasure, and loves fame, also loves mankind, but only he who loves virtue.

### 14

> As you would not choose to sail in a large and decorated and gold-laden ship, and to be drowned; so do not choose to dwell in a large and costly house and to be disturbed (by cares).

### 20

> As when you see a viper or an asp or a scorpion in an ivory or golden box, you do not on account of the costliness of the material love it or think it happy, but because the nature of it is pernicious, you turn away from it and loath it; so when you shall see vice dwelling in wealth and in the swollen fullness of fortune, be not struck by the splendor of the material, but despise the false character of the morals.

### 26

> Neither is a horse elated nor proud of his manger and trappings and coverings, nor a bird of his little shreds of cloth and of his nest: but both of them are proud of their swiftness, one proud of the swiftness of the feet, and the other of the wings. Do you also then not be greatly proud of your food and dress and, in short, of any external things, but be proud of your integrity and good deeds.

### 35

> ...for a man who is drunk could not teach a man who is sober, nor on the other hand could a drunken man be convinced by a sober man.

### 88

> As the sun does not wait for prayers and incantations to be induced to rise, but immediately shines and is saluted by all: so do you also not wait for clappings of hands, and shouts and praise to be induced to do good, but be a doer of good voluntarily, and you will be beloved as much as the son

### 93

> Pyrrho used to say that there is no difference between dying and living and a man said to him, Why then do you not die? Pyrrho replied, Because there is no difference.

### 105

> Listen to those who wish to advise what is useful, but not to those who are eager to flatter on all occasions; for the first really see what is useful, but the second look to that which agrees with the opinion of those who possess power, and imitating the shadows of bodies they assent to what is said by the powerful.

### 111

> It is part of a wise man to resist pleasures, but of a foolish man to be a slave to them.

### 121

> As it is pleasant to see the sea from the land, so it is pleasant for him who has escaped from troubles to think of them.

### 142

> Nature has given men one tongue, but two ears, that we may hear from others twice as much as we speak.

### 155

> When our friends are present, we ought to treat them well; and when they are absent, to speak of them well.

### 170

> When a young man was boasting in the theater and saying, I am wise, for I have conversed with many wise men; Epictetus said, I also have conversed with many rich men, but I am not rich.

### 176

> You are a little soul carrying a dead body.
