<h1 class="display">Extras</h1>
<p class="intro">Here is a list of my lists. I mostly keep these lists for the sake of my own memory.</p>
<section>
<a href="/thinking" class="postlink">
<time></time>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<p><small>This is a list of status updates and commentary that is used to populate Twitter and other social networks. It is important to me to preserve these comments on my site as social networks come and go.</small></p>
</a>
</section>
<section>
<a href="/reading/books" class="postlink">
<time></time>
<h2>Books</h2>
<p><small>I attribute my increased reading in recent years to the Amazon Kindle. The portability and ease of highlighting passages makes it indispensable.</small></p>
</a>
</section>
<section>
<a href="/reading/audiobooks" class="postlink">
<time></time>
<h2>Audiobooks</h2>
<p><small>Audiobooks really got me interested in 'reading' several years ago. The truth is, the increase in good podcast content has slowed my audiobook consumption.</small></p>
</a>
</section>
<section>
<a href="/watching/movies" class="postlink">
<time></time>
<h2>Movies</h2>
<p><small>As far as I know, this is the complete list of every movie I have ever seen.</small></p>
</a>
</section>
<section>
<a href="/watching/series" class="postlink">
<time></time>
<h2>Series</h2>
<p><small>It is hard to consider this a complete list since series tend to come and go but I do my best to keep track.</small></p>
</a>
</section>
<section>
<a href="/listening" class="postlink">
<time></time>
<h2>Listening</h2>
<p><small>I consider all of these albums among my favorites but many of them are listed here because they have special personal meaning.</small></p>
</a>
</section>
<section>
<a href="/traveling" class="postlink">
<time></time>
<h2>Traveling</h2>
<p><small>I have been to some neat places but there is plenty more to see.</small></p>
</a>
</section>
<section>
<a href="/golfing" class="postlink">
<time></time>
<h2>Golfing</h2>
<p><small>I have been fortunate enough to play some incredible golf courses. I keep track of them here.</small></p>
</a>
</section>
<section>
<a href="/baseball" class="postlink">
<time></time>
<h2>Baseball</h2>
<p><small>I don't have a life long goal of going to every baseball team's stadium but the more the merrier.</small></p>
</a>
</section>
<section>
<a href="/gaming" class="postlink">
<time></time>
<h2>Gaming</h2>
<p><small>In the spring of 2019 I built my first PC. Naturally, I felt the need to log the games I complete or play extensively. I do hope to go back one day and catalog my previous gaming life.</small></p>
