<p class="intro">I started this newsletter in January of 2018. The motivation was selfish; I was bookmarking too many articles and links that I didn't get around to reading. Filtering out the best to share helps me keep that list manageable. The full archive of previous editions is available <a href="#archive">below</a>.</p>
